It was recorded at Studio Dierks by Dieter Dierks during breaks in the sessions for the Walter WegmÃƒÂ¼ller album Tarot.\n\n  \nThe album features two side-long pieces that represent literally two sides of the band, the Krautrock and space music incarnations. &quot;Freak 'n' Roll&quot; is a 19-minute hard-hitting jam, with Schulze bashing away behind the drums and Manuel GÃƒÂ¶ttsching churning some mean guitar riffs while Harmut Enke ploughs heavy basslines. The track is actually an excerpt from a longer improvisation and begins with a fade in that throws the listener in the middle of an already heated session. Long but hardly long-winded, this track deserves a place alongside Can's &quot;You Do Right&quot; and Faust's &quot;Krautrock&quot;: it has the drive, the psychedelic appeal, and the creativity of what epitomized the Krautrock style in the minds of young Englishmen and Americans for a while. \n\nThe 24-minute &quot;Jenseits&quot; sees Schulze at the Synthi A and the organ, weaving dreamy drones and uplifting chords for GÃƒÂ¶ttsching to doodle over.\n \nJoin Inn marks the end of the collaboration with Klaus Schulze. \nHowever, together with Ash Ra Tempel first album of the band, it is considered a highlight of the Krautrock movement.\n\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n\n \n\t\n\n\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cb65aaca99bdc8884b94eb7bd34d2cc0fc63683","amp;dn":"Ash+Ra+Tempel+-+Join+Inn+%2F+1973","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cb65aaca99bdc8884b94eb7bd34d2cc0fc63683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,182,90,172,169,155,220,136,132,185,78,183,189,52,210,204,15,198,54,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
