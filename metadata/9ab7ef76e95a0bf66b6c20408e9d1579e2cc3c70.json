Cowell would then whittle this number\ndown to around 40 which he then presented to Mac for consideration.\nMac would then tell Cowell which of these would or would not work.\nWhen the song list had been reduced to around 18 or 19 songs Mac\nwould then try out the songs with the band to see which worked for\nthem. 15 songs would then be recorded for the album.\n\nThe songs on Siempre (&quot;Always&quot; in Spanish) include new arrangements of\n&quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; [originally by The Moody Blues], &quot;Caruso&quot;,\n&quot;Without You&quot;, &quot;Somewhere&quot;, &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;, a new version of the song\n&quot;Music&quot; from the 1970s renamed &quot;Musica&quot;, and re-arranged by its original\nBritish composer John Miles. The album also features a cover of Bryan\nAdams' &quot;Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?&quot; translated into the Spanish\n&quot;Un Regalo Que Te Dio La Vida&quot;\n[which literally means &quot;A Gift That Life Gave You&quot;].
