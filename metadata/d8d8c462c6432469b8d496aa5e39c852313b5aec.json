Threatened both personally and professionally, brilliant psychotherapist Atsuko Chiba has to journey into the world of fantasy to fight her mysterious opponents. As she delves ever deeper into the imagination, the borderline between dream and reality becomes increasingly blurred, and nightmares begin to leak into the everyday realm. The scene is set for a final showdown between the dream detective and her enemies, with the subconscious as their battleground, and the future of the waking world at stake.\n\nSatoshi Kon directed an anime adaptation of the same name.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8d8c462c6432469b8d496aa5e39c852313b5aec","amp;dn":"anime%2C+Paprika%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8d8c462c6432469b8d496aa5e39c852313b5aec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,216,196,98,198,67,36,105,184,212,150,170,94,57,200,82,49,59,90,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
