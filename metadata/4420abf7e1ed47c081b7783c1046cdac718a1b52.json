Met some great people.  Saw some beautiful things.  But that didn't stop me from occasionally finding internet connectivity to keep on top, and grab some of the latest releases for you all.\n\nThat being said, I am already planning my next trip.  And it may happen within a week or so if I can gather together enough essential supplies.  If it works out as I hope it will, this trip will be quite isolated.  No internet.  No gas station for miles and miles.  No people.  Nothing but God's glorious untouched creation.  The type of trip where if you're not packing some groceries and several cans of gas in a cargo holder, you're in trouble.  So I'm rather looking forward to it.  I may even do a little crossbow hunting while I'm gone.  Nothing like catching your own breakfast.\n\nBut getting back to today's torrent.  It's been a long time in coming.  I appreciate everyone's patience while I was away.  Hopefully one or two of these titles being shared today will be of interest to you.  I'm currently working on Bundle 23, but I'm not sure when I'll be able to tossed it up.  But I'll try my best.\n\nALTERNATIVE: Anberlin, Ember Days, Jars of Clay, Sleeping At Last.
