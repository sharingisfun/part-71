At once a memoir, meditation on the artistic process, and advice on craft, Still Writing is an intimate and eloquent companion to living a creative life. \n\nThrough a blend of deeply personal stories about what formed her as a writer, tales from other authors, and a searching look at her own creative process, Shapiro offers her gift to writers everywhere: an elegant guide of hard-won wisdom and advice for staying the course. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The writerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life requires courage, patience, empathy, openness. It requires the ability to be alone with oneself. Gentle with oneself. To be disciplined, and at the same time, take risks.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ WritersÃ¢â‚¬â€and anyone with an artistic temperamentÃ¢â‚¬â€will find inspiration and comfort in these pages. Offering lessons learned over twenty years of teaching and writing, Shapiro brings her own revealing insights to weave an indispensable almanac for modern writers.\n\nLike Anne LamottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bird by Bird, Virginia WoolfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s A WriterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Diary, and Stephen KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s On Writing, Dani ShapiroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Still Writing is a lodestar for aspiring scribes and an eloquent memoir of the writing life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0ab5889a36bd460fac433718bda8da9554ac096","amp;dn":"Still+Writing%3A+The+Perils+and+Pleasures+of+a+Creative+Life+-+Dan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0ab5889a36bd460fac433718bda8da9554ac096","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,171,88,137,163,107,212,96,250,196,51,113,139,218,141,169,85,74,192,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
