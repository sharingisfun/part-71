She emerged a woman transformed, with an exquisite beauty found only in fairy tales. Nell Calder deserved a happy ending. Instead, her descent into terror has just begun.\n\nHer attacker is still on the hunt, determined to finish what he's started. And Nell, protected by a new face, is just as determined to fight back and take her revenge. But to catch her prey, she will have to expose herself--even if it makes her a killer's prime target.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e29fb9c246151fb7d6653fdd1abc635c06f145a2","amp;dn":"Iris+Johansen+-+The+Ugly+Duckling+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e29fb9c246151fb7d6653fdd1abc635c06f145a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,159,185,194,70,21,31,183,214,101,63,221,26,188,99,92,6,241,69,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
