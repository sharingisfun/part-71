Facing impossible odds, the men fought 78 miles to freedom and saved the lives of 98,000 civilian refugees. Chosin is the first-ever documentary on the Chosin Reservoir Campaign. Presented in full, immersive HD, the stories of our veterans are supplemented with rare black and white and color archival footage gathered from hundreds of hours of research. After 60 years of silence, the survivors of the campaign take us on an emotional and heart-pounding journey through one of the most savage battles in American history. These first-hand accounts, combined with footage never before seen by most Americans, create a visceral, emotionally charged experience unlike that provided by any other war documentary. As a fellow combat veteran, director Brian Iglesias forged a unique connection with the men he interviewed.&quot;\n\nSorry, resolution is shit 842x480, that's how I downloaded it and that's all I can do for you. But at least you get to watch it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92c5cddf74bff0fb196f2bc4d37cd192fd18c6b7","amp;dn":"Chosin+re-upload+upon+request","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92c5cddf74bff0fb196f2bc4d37cd192fd18c6b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,197,205,223,116,191,240,251,25,111,43,196,211,124,209,146,253,24,198,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
