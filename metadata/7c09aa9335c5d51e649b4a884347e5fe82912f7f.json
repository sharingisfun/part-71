It stars Maurice Chevalier as a tailor who poses as a nobleman and Jeanette MacDonald as a princess with whom he falls in love. It also stars Charles Ruggles as a penniless nobleman, along with Charles Butterworth and Myrna Loy as members of his family.\n\nThe film is an adaptation by Samuel Hoffenstein, George Marion Jr. and Waldemar Young of the play by Paul Armont and LÃƒÂ©opold Marchand. It features the classic Rodgers and Hart songs &quot;Love Me Tonight&quot;, &quot;Isn't it Romantic?&quot;, &quot;Mimi&quot;, and &quot;Lover&quot;. &quot;Lover&quot; is sung not romantically, as it often is in nightclubs, but comically, as MacDonald's character tries to control an unruly horse. The staging of &quot;Isn't It Romantic?&quot; was revolutionary for its time, combining both singing and film editing, as the song is passed from one singer (or group of singers) to another, all of whom are at different locales.\n\nIn 1990, Love Me Tonight was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Maurice Chevalier as Maurice, Baron Courtelin\n    Jeanette MacDonald as Princesse Jeanette\n    Charles Ruggles as Vicomte Gilbert de VarÃƒÂ¨ze \n    Charles Butterworth as Comte de Savignac\n    Myrna Loy as Comtesse Valentine\n    C.

These include Vicomte Gilbert de VarÃƒÂ¨ze (Ruggles), who owes Maurice a large amount of money for tailoring work; Gilbert's uncle the Duc d'Artelines (C. Aubrey Smith), the family patriarch; d'Artelines' man-hungry niece Valentine (Loy); and his other 22-year-old niece, Princesse Jeanette (MacDonald), who has been a widow for three years. D'Artelines has been unable to find Jeanette a new husband of suitable age and rank. The household also includes three aunts and an ineffectual suitor the Comte de Savignac (Butterworth).\n\nMaurice custom-tailors clothing for de VarÃƒÂ¨ze on credit, but the Vicomte's unpaid tailoring bills become intolerable, so Maurice travels to de Savignac's castle to collect the money owed to him. On the way, he has a confrontation with Princesse Jeanette. He immediately professes his love for her, but she haughtily rejects him.\n\nWhen Maurice arrives at the castle, Gilbert introduces him as &quot;Baron Courtelin&quot; in order to hide the truth from the Comte . Maurice is fearful of this scheme at first, but changes his mind when he sees Jeanette. While staying at the castle, he arouses Valentine's desire, charms the rest of the family except for Jeanette, saves a deer's life during a hunt, and continues to woo Jeanette. The Comte de Savignac discovers that Maurice is a fake, but the Vicomte then claims that Maurice is a royal who is traveling incognito for security reasons. Finally, Jeanette succumbs to Maurice's charms, telling him &quot;Whoever you are, whatever you are, wherever you are, I love you.&quot;\n\nWhen Maurice criticizes Jeanette's tailor, the family confronts him for his rudeness, only to catch him and Jeanette alone with Jeanette partially undressed. Maurice explains that he is redesigning Jeanette's riding outfit, and he proves this by successfully altering it, but in the process he is forced to reveal his true identity. Despite her earlier promise, Jeanette recoils from him and runs to her room on hearing that he is a commoner. The entire household is outraged, and Maurice leaves. However, as a train carries him back to Paris, Jeanette struggles with her fears, finally realizes her mistake, and catches up to the train on horseback. When the engineer refuses to stop the train, she rides ahead and stands on the track. The train stops, Maurice jumps out, and the two lovers embrace as steam from the train envelops them.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4999 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 104 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 104 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c09aa9335c5d51e649b4a884347e5fe82912f7f","amp;dn":"Love+Me+Tonight+%281932%29+DVD5+-+Jeanette+MacDonald%2C+Maurice+Cheval","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c09aa9335c5d51e649b4a884347e5fe82912f7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,9,170,147,53,197,213,30,100,155,74,136,67,71,229,254,130,145,47,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
