The game was released in 1991 for the Macintosh and in 1994 for Windows.\n\nThe game was a first person adventure set in a sci-fi future. The player explores and interacts the game universe by clicking. Limited manipulation of objects is needed and there are several optional locations and things the player can explore or discover besides following the linear narrative. Dialogues involve typing a topic to a character such as &quot;whiskey&quot;, &quot;Terra&quot; or &quot;pirates&quot;. Some arcade sequences enrich the gameplay.\n\nSpaceship Warlock was one of the earliest and best-known multimedia CD-ROM games to combine all original animation, story, music, and game play. The game menu refers to itself as a movie. Graphically ahead of its time and acquired a cult following. Spaceship Warlock is widely considered a pioneering work, and it received many awards and honors, including the &quot;Game of the Year&quot; award from Macworld magazine.\n\nSome of the game's outer space scenes are reminiscent of the art of Chesley Bonestell.\n\n\n-BUSTAKappa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0317ad1f5ae15524fe21c3ef240a75015c60b7f","amp;dn":"Spaceship+Warlock+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0317ad1f5ae15524fe21c3ef240a75015c60b7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,49,122,209,245,174,21,82,79,226,28,62,242,64,167,80,21,198,11,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
