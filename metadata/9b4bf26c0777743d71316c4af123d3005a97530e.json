Max Faccioni appears to be a typical hardboiled detective in the mold of Sam Spade. His clients are a bit more colorful than most, but include the standard damsels in distress, shady mob types, and boxers who are being forced to take a dive. Zombies and hints of black magic spice things up in issue #1. \n\nWhat artist/writer GÃƒÂ©rard Goffaux aka Goff does, which is truly inventive, is to cast a framing story of a newspaperman in the 1980s first finding what appears to be MaxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body, then being approached by a gunman looking for research on Faccioni. Both incidents are used as a launching pad for telling the stories of MaxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illustrious past. \n\nPlease SEED and Enjoy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b4bf26c0777743d71316c4af123d3005a97530e","amp;dn":"Detective%3A+Chronicles+of+Max+Faccioni+%281998%29+G%26eacute%3Brard+Goffa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b4bf26c0777743d71316c4af123d3005a97530e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,75,242,108,7,119,116,61,113,49,108,74,241,35,211,0,90,151,83,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
