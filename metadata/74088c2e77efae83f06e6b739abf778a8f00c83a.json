The new song by Dierks Bentley (Drunk On A Plane) is the only debut, while Bottoms Up slides down the chart to become a recurrent.  It is also worthy of note that Luke Bryan can be heard both in the number 2 and 3 positions of this weeks chart, as a guest and on his own. \n\nHere are the Top 30 U.S. Country singles for the week as ranked by Mediabase.  All are 320 constant bit-rate Stereo and ripped from either ERGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nu Country Traxx, Promo Only Country Radio, the iTunes single or the actual artist CD.
