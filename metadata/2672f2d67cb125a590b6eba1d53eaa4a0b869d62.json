I ripped as FLAC for all cd's, initially using EAC (my first experience with EAC), which I now hate.  I kept the logs, and because of the instability and slow processing of the program started using foobar2000 (highly recommend to everybody, a do-everything free media player) and wavepad to rip my cd's.  \n\n\nI'm hoping that others who regularly use torrents for their media will take this as an inspiration to share whatever media you may have, even if it's something you aren't interested in, others might be.  \n\n\nI would like to give credit to foobar2000, which is impressing me more and more as i find new uses for it (also splits those annoying whole album flac files you find here occasion without re-encoding, so that you are still actually using a LOSSLESS file, which medieval apparently does not do).  if you use EAC, please consider using foobar.  it works 3x faster, and if you run into a scratch on an old cd, foobar won't stop processing for you (eac did this for me), nor will it cause any kind of computer crash, lag or slow your computer down.  it's simplistic, capable, wonderful.  \n\n\nanyways, youre probably wondering what is in this torrent? here goes:\n\n\nAlabama                -     Greatest Hits Vol. III               (13 tracks, 1994, 234 MB)\nBrooks &amp; Dunn          -     The Greatest Hits Collection II      (17 tracks, 2004, 454 MB)\nCarrie Underwood       -     Carnival Ride                        (13 tracks, 2007, 357 MB)\nFive For Fighting      -     Two Lights                           (10 tracks, 2006, 280 MB)\nHarry Connick, Jr.     -     Chanson Du Vieux CarrÃƒÂ©               (12 tracks, 2003, 359 MB)\nJo Dee Messina         -     Burn                                 (11 tracks, 2000, 308 MB)\nJohnny Cash            -     Unchained                            (14 tracks, 1996, 277 MB)\nKeith Urban            -     Love, Pain &amp; The Whole Crazy Thing   (13 tracks, 2006, 418 MB)\nMartina McBride        -     Emotion                              (12 tracks, 1999, 310 MB)\nRandy Travis           -     Passing Through                      (12 tracks, 2004, 264 MB)\nRascal Flatts          -     Feels Like Today                     (12 tracks, 2004, 302 MB)\nRascal Flatts          -     Me And My Gang                       (16 tracks, 2006, 461 MB)\nReba McEntire          -     Reba Duets                           (12 tracks, 2007, 279 MB)\nSara Evans             -     Real Fine Place                      (13 tracks, 2005, 373 MB)\nSting                  -     The Journey &amp; The Labyrinth          ( 8 tracks, 2007, 142 MB)\nTim McGraw             -     Let It Go                            (13 tracks, 2007, 351 MB)\nToby Keith             -     Unleashed                            (13 tracks, 2002, 274 MB)\n\nnotes:\nMost of the albums have a log report from EAC, I only remembered to generate a cue for a couple albums (but if it's really necessary, feel free to write or generate your own, isn't very difficult).  when I ripped with foobar, I kept the converter status report.  All of these items I consider almost unnecessary as to what they actually report, but they may be of some help to you and it seems to be convention here I so I included them.  I tagged everything properly, the album art is a little tricky for me, it appears that when I play the file in VLC of Foobar I see the album art that the add-ons to the cd rippers gave me, but they don't appear in mp3tag for me (this has been an issue for me before, if anyone knows anything about this please share in the comments).  \nMe And My Gang is an extended version from target.  I included the enhanced features for all cd's, but they really don't do anything for you but lead you to an expired url.  \n\nAnd the usual one, please seed.  The reason I made this crazy collection is because either noone wants to seed them, or they aren't available in FLAC or at all.  Whether you only download one or two albums, or do me and the world a favor and seed the whole thing, please seed for a while.  \n\nEnjoy everybody.  Also, this is my second try at a torrent (my last was the good eats series, if you're interested: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7684385/Good_Eats)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7684385/Good_Eats)&lt;/a&gt; so any critiquing of anything is welcome.  please don't share stupid ranting irrelevancies in the comments.
