In addition, each audio file has an ID3 tag image of the book's album cover, the proper track number (in relation to all the tracks), and proper section information.\n\nThis makes it MUCH easier to enjoy while listening on a smart phone or other mp3 player, go back and re-listen, or keep track of where you left off.  I figured if I'm going to go through the trouble of properly organizing the files, I may as well share it with the world.  I also included the eBook to follow along with.\n\nI edited the ebook to have the correct titles for the table of contents.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n=========================================================================================\n\nWhat keeps so many of us from doing what we long to do? Why is there a naysayer within? How can we avoid the roadblocks of any creative endeavorÃ¢â‚¬â€be it starting up a dream business venture, writing a novel, or painting a masterpiece?\n\nThe War of Art identifies the enemy that every one of us must face, outlines a battle plan to conquer this internal foe, then pinpoints just how to achieve the greatest success.\n\nThe War of Art emphasizes the resolve needed to recognize and overcome the obstacles of ambition and then effectively shows how to reach the highest level of creative discipline. Think of it as tough love . . . for yourself. \n\n=========================================================================================\n\nAUDIO FILES:\n\n01 - Introduction\n   01 - Introduction.mp3\n   02 - Foreward.mp3\n   03 - What I Do.mp3\n   04 - What I Know.mp3\n   05 - The Unlived Life.mp3\n\n02 - Book One - Resistance, Defining the Enemy\n   06 - Resistance's Greatest Hits.mp3\n   07 - Resistance Is Invisible.mp3\n   08 - Resistance Is Internal.mp3\n   09 - Resistance Is Insidious.mp3\n   10 - Resistance Is Implacable.mp3\n   11 - Resistance Is Impersonal.mp3\n   12 - Resistance Is Infallible.mp3\n   13 - Resistance Is Universal.mp3\n   14 - Resistance Never Sleeps.mp3\n   15 - Resistance Plays For Keeps.mp3\n   16 - Resistance Is Fueled By Fear.mp3\n   17 - Resistance Only Opposes In One Direction.mp3\n   18 - Resistance Is Most Powerful at the Finishline.mp3\n   19 - Resistance Recruits Allies.mp3\n   20 - Resistance and Procrastination.mp3\n   21 - Resistance and Procrastination, Part Two.mp3\n   22 - Resistance and Sex.mp3\n   23 - Resistance and Trouble.mp3\n   24 - Resistance and Self-Dramatization.mp3\n   25 - Resistance and Self-Medication.mp3\n   26 - Resistance and Victimhood.mp3\n   27 - Resistance and the Choice of a Mate.mp3\n   28 - Resistance and This Book.mp3\n   29 - Resistance and Unhappiness.mp3\n   30 - Resistance and Fundamentalism.mp3\n   31 - Resistance and Criticism.mp3\n   32 - Resistance and Self-Doubt.mp3\n   33 - Resistance and Fear.mp3\n   34 - Resistance and Love.mp3\n   35 - Resistance and Being a Star.mp3\n   36 - Resistance and Isolation.mp3\n   37 - Resistance and Isolation, Part Two.mp3\n   38 - Resistance and Healing.mp3\n   39 - Resistance and Support.mp3\n   40 - Resistance and Rationalization.mp3\n   41 - Resistance and Rationalization, Part Two.mp3\n   42 - Resistance Can Be Beaten.mp3\n\n03 - Book Two - Combating Resistance, Turning Pro\n   43 - Resistance and Amateurs.mp3\n   44 - A Professional.mp3\n   45 - What A Writer's Day Feels Like.mp3\n   46 - How To Be Miserable.mp3\n   47 - We're All Pros Already.mp3\n   48 - For Love of the Game.mp3\n   49 - A Professional Is Patient.mp3\n   50 - A Professional Seeks Order.mp3\n   51 - A Professional Demystifies.mp3\n   52 - A Professional Acts in the Face of Fear.mp3\n   53 - A Professional Accepts No Excuses.mp3\n   54 - A Professional Plays It As It Lays.mp3\n   55 - A Professional Is Prepared.mp3\n   56 - A Professional Does Not Show Off.mp3\n   57 - A Professional Dedicates Himself To Mastering Technique.mp3\n   58 - A Professional Does Not Hesitate To Ask For Help.mp3\n   59 - A Professional Distances Herself From Her Instrument.mp3\n   60 - A Professional Does Not Take Failure (Or Success) Personally.mp3\n   61 - A Professional Endures Adversity.mp3\n   62 - A Professional Self-Validates.mp3\n   63 - A Professional Recognizes Her Limitations.mp3\n   64 - A Professional Reinvents Himself.mp3\n   65 - A Professional Is Recognized By Other Professionals.mp3\n   66 - You, Inc.mp3\n   67 - A Critter That Keeps Coming.mp3\n   68 - No Mystery.mp3\n\n04 - Book Three - Beyond Resistance, The Higher Realm\n   69 - Angels in the Abstract.mp3\n   70 - Approaching the Mystery.mp3\n   71 - Invoking the Muse.mp3\n   72 - Invoking the Muse, Part Two.mp3\n   73 - Testament of A Visionary.mp3\n   74 - Invoking the Muse, Part Three.mp3\n   75 - The Magic of Making A Start.mp3\n   76 - The Magic of Keeping Going.mp3\n   77 - Largo.mp3\n   78 - Life and Death.mp3\n   79 - The Ego and the Self.mp3\n   80 - Experiencing the Self.mp3\n   81 - Fear.mp3\n   82 -The Authentic Self.mp3\n   83 - Territory Versus Hierarchy.mp3\n   84 - The Hierarchical Orientation.mp3\n   85 - The Artist and the Hierarchy.mp3\n   86 - The Definition of a Hack.mp3\n   87 - The Territorial Orientation.mp3\n   88 - The Artist and the Territory.mp3\n   89 - The Difference Between Territory and Hierarchy.mp3\n   90 - The Supreme Virtue.mp3\n   91 - The Fruits of Our Labor.mp3\n   92 - Portrait of the Artist.mp3\n   93 - The Artist's Life.mp3\n   94 - The End.mp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46e5d3bda50461e927b60258f8fa16a7d94ac90d","amp;dn":"The+War+of+Art+-+Steven+Pressfield+%28organized+audio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46e5d3bda50461e927b60258f8fa16a7d94ac90d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,229,211,189,165,4,97,233,39,182,2,88,248,250,22,167,217,74,201,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
