The book discusses the major contributors to the Pop/Mass-Culture Art tradition right up to the present, including a number of artists who have never previously been associated with so-called Pop Art but whose work showed a strong interest in mass-culture. The book reproduces, in colour and in great detail, over 150 of the key works of the Pop/Mass-Culture Art tradition, allowing the reader to have a closer look and better understanding of these images.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daf55070d02116ce028ecb9b00bdb6243ce5c9c8","amp;dn":"Pop+Art.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daf55070d02116ce028ecb9b00bdb6243ce5c9c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,245,80,112,208,33,22,206,2,142,203,155,0,189,182,36,60,229,201,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
