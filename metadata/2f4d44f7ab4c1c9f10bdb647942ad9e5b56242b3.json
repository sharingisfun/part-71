A former member of Michael Bloomberg's Mayors Against Illegal Guns campaign admitted last week to leaving the group after discovering it &quot;intended to promote confiscation of guns from law-abiding citizens.&quot; It's no coincidence also that Austin City Council Member Mike Martinez, a potential for Mayor of Austin, also alluded to a total outright gun ban during a Moms Demand Action rally last year. \n\nWe'll also discuss why the true players behind actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman's death have gotten away scot-free, the escalating tensions with Iran and take calls.\n\nNote: This upload is the Prison Planet &quot;members' edit&quot; audio of the show.\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
