No Hi-Res formats or SHM-CD rips have been used.\n\nInstead, a series of minor EQ adjustments and digital filters have been utilised, to increase the bass, brighten the treble, and maximise the overall loudness of the audio from the original Compact Discs.\n\nHearing is very subjective, but I hope you enjoy these &quot;tweaked&quot; files, until (hopefully) officially-released professional remasters are available to buy.\n\nTry downloading a couple of the MP3 files from the torrent first, and then if you like what you hear, grab the FLAC too","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5176c539bc49e0c2a84ca95ca4c642df8beb9c1","amp;dn":"The+Family+%28Prince%29+-+The+Family+%281985%29+-+FLAC+-+FDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5176c539bc49e0c2a84ca95ca4c642df8beb9c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,23,108,83,155,196,158,12,42,132,202,149,202,76,100,45,248,190,185,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
