Determined to start over where no one knows her, she answers a housing ad on Craigslist and takes a job at a little bar in a town she has never heard of. All Sophia's looking for is a place to escape, somewhere she can hide behind her lies and keep herself distracted. She just didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect to be distracted by Corbin Kasey. Twenty-five-year-old Corbin Kasey is stuck in his hometown, his job, and his life, spending more time covering for his DadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problems than trying to fix his own. To take his mind off everything he has the wild Kayla, his stable roommates, and the calmness of swimming in Mills Lake. He always thought it was enough to keep him from drowning in himself, until he meets Sophia. Neither of them are prepared for their lies to be stripped away by a single kiss. But for Corbin and Sophia, the truth has consequences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:502b682ab7b779b77b97799b1b2a345472574788","amp;dn":"Hannah_T_J_-The_Truth_About_Us.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"502b682ab7b779b77b97799b1b2a345472574788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,43,104,42,183,183,121,183,123,151,121,155,27,42,52,84,114,87,71,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
