Stefansson documented the fact that the Inuit diet consisted of about 90% meat and fish; Inuit would often go 6 to 9 months a year eating nothing but meat and fishÃ¢â‚¬â€what was perceived to have been a no-carbohydrate diet. He found that he and his fellow explorers of European descent were also perfectly healthy on such a diet. While there was considerable skepticism when he reported these findings, they have been borne out in recent studies and analyses. In multiple studies, the Inuit diet was not been shown be a ketogenic diet and roughly 15-20% of its calories are derived from carbohydrates, largely from the glycogen found in the raw meats. When medical authorities questioned him on his findings, he and a fellow explorer agreed to undertake a study under the auspices of the Journal of the American Medical Association to demonstrate that they could eat a 100% meat diet in a closely observed laboratory setting for the first several weeks, with paid observers for the rest of an entire year. Stefansson was compensated for his efforts by the American Meat Institute. The results were published in the Journal, and both men were perfectly healthy on such a diet, without vitamin supplementation or anything else in their diet except meat and entrails.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbad0d95a8cecd53e768088917e5c33548c2eb86","amp;dn":"The+Fat+of+the+Land+by+Vilhjalmur+Stefansson+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbad0d95a8cecd53e768088917e5c33548c2eb86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,173,13,149,168,206,205,83,231,104,8,137,23,229,195,53,72,194,235,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
