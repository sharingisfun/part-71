You might be wondering where is the latest Wolverine solo\ntitle? The Hellfire Saga, Battle of the Atom, the Apocalypse Twins?\nWell they just don't fit yet.  Also is Rogue actually dead?  I'm \nstill not sure how long Wolverine will be without his healing this \ntime, but I figure in another month or two I should be able to sort \nout the next round of Chronological X-Men which has a ton of good \nstuff in it.\n\nThis includes the Age of Ultron and Infinity which you may likely\nalready have.  If so, just deselect and pop in your own files.\nNext round will also include Ultimate X-Men files.\n\nI am a big fan of the previous Chrono-packs and really enjoy \nreading runs of comics rather than as they come out month by month.  \nI have gone with the highest rez, best looking versions of each \nissue that I could come up with.\n  \nMy ground rules for inclusion are pretty broad.  \nI am trying to follow all of the mutants that we know and love \nwhere ever they appear.  So for instance if Wolverine, Storm, \nor the Beast are in an Avengers title, I include it, but if \nno mutants are included in a storyline at all I probably exclude it.  \nI consider Deadpool to be part of the mutant family, so you \nwill see his stuff here also.  I think the orders here work \npretty well, but you can reorder stuff as you see fit.  \nIf anyone has suggestions of issues I might have missed let me know.  \nI will try to work them in.\n\nThese are not my scans.  I have been in awe of the folks \nthat turn out such amazing scans and you will find most \nscans are tagged by their makers.\n   \nLet us hope that the sharing continues.\n\nThese issues are from the Marvel Universe with various authors \nand illustrator, to numerous for me to list.\n\nIssues are all from 2009, 2012-2014.\n\nThe format of all the files is either .cbr or .cbz and the \nlanguage is ENGLISH, and various weird made up alien languages.\n\nIssues in the Torrent:\n\nWolverine MAX 1-15\nWolverine - Japan's Most Wanted 1-13\nSavage Wolverine - 1-13\nThunderbolts - 7-18\nFearless Defenders 3-10\nAge of Ultron 1-10\nFantastic Four 5 AU\nSuperior Spider-Man 6 AU\nAvengers Assemble 14 AU\nUltron 1 AU\nAvengers Assemble 14 &amp; 15 AU\nWolverine and the X-Men 27 AU\nUncanny Avengers 8 AU\nFearless Defenders 4 AU\nAge of Ultron 10 AI\nWolverine and the X-Men 29\nX-Men Legacy 7-18\nCable and X-Force 5-14\nAvengers Arena 8-18\nGambit 13-17\nAll-New X-Men 11-15\nAll-New X-Men Special 1\nIndestructible Hulk Special 1\nSuperior Spider-Man Team-Up Special 1\nUncanny X-Men 5-11\nDeadpool 7-19\nA + X - 6-12\nUncanny X-Force 5-15\nScarlet Spider 17-19\nAstonishing X-Men 62-68\nX-Men 1-4\nWolverine Custom Edition 1\nDeadpool Kills Deadpool 1-4\nWolverine - In the Flesh 1\nX-Factor 257-262\nAvengers 12-23\nNew Avengers 6-12\nGuardians of the Galaxy 4-9\nAvengers - The Enemy Within 1\nAvengers Assemble 16-20\nCaptain Marvel 13-15\nInfinity 1-6\nInfinity - Against the Tide 1-2\nNova 8-9\nInfinity The Hunt 1-4 \nMighty Avengers 1-3\nInfinity Heist 1-4\nSuperior Spider-Man Team-Up 3-4\nSecret Avengers 10-11\nWolverine and the Avengers Annual 1\nTimestorm 2009-2099 1-4\nTimestorm 2009-2099 Spider-Man\nTimestorm 2009-2099 X-Men\nAge of Apocalypse 8\nDeapool (2012) 50-63\n\nPrevious collections can be found here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8503745/Chronological_X-Men_-_Post_AvX_to_X-Termination&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8503745/Chronological_X-Men_-_Post_AvX_to_X-Termination&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8315591/Chronological_X-Men_Pack_2012_Continued&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8315591/Chronological_X-Men_Pack_2012_Continued&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8277364/Chronological_X-Men_Pack_30&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8277364/Chronological_X-Men_Pack_30&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8273527/Chronological_X-Men_Pack_29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8273527/Chronological_X-Men_Pack_29&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8273045/Chronological_X-Men_Pack_28_%28missing_from_previous%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8273045/Chronological_X-Men_Pack_28_%28missing_from_previous%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5a2016c0fab329e35f502f99f3a8ae3f37558f0","amp;dn":"Chronological+X-Men+-+Post+X-Termination+to+Infinity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5a2016c0fab329e35f502f99f3a8ae3f37558f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,162,1,108,15,171,50,158,53,245,2,249,159,58,138,227,243,117,88,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
