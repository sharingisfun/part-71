Recently returned from the war in Algeria, Mesrine soon bores of the 9 to 5 life and gradually drifts into a life of crime under the tutelage of veteran gangster Guido (GÃƒÂ©rard Depardieu). He quickly discovers he has a gift for robbing banks and forms a duo with lover Jeanne Schneider (CÃƒÂ©cile de France) to rival Bonnie and Clyde. When the couple is finally hunted down in the Arizona desert, Mesrine is sentenced to ten years in a maximum-security penitentiary. But he is about to prove that no prison is big enough to contain him.Public Enemy No. 1  Directed by Jean-Francois Richet and starring GÃƒÂ©rard Depardieu, Cecile de France, Vincent Cassel and Gilles Lellouche.\n\nFrom France, in French\n\nSubtitles by SBS AU TV\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2faa2f13d3efe2a15897104f7d33da23ef8add8","amp;dn":"Public+Enemy+No.+1++%28Part+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2faa2f13d3efe2a15897104f7d33da23ef8add8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,250,162,241,61,62,254,42,21,137,113,4,247,211,61,162,62,248,173,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
