This is a half-hour glimpse into &quot;Hebrew Roots - Part 6&quot; or &quot;The Mind of the Messiah - Part 1&quot;. For 4 hours I taught Discover Church what it means to have &quot;the mind of Christ&quot;... then how to apply this revelation to faith, family and justice. And yes, you will get some end times preparation, too. I pray you will enjoy getting to know the Messiah in a fresh way.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn Evening with Ravi Zacharias, Dennis Prager and Jeff Foxworthy:\n&quot;The Death of Truth and the Decline of Culture&quot;\n\nOn Thursday, October 17th at 7:00 pm, nationally syndicated radio show host Dennis Prager (www.dennisprager.com) and world-renowned Christian apologist Ravi Zacharias (www.rzim.org) will appear on stage together at Perimeter Church in Johns Creek, GA.\n\nThe evening will be hosted by comedian, actor and best-selling author Jeff Foxworthy.\n\nWe live in trying times. Those of us who take belief in the God of the Bible seriously feel burdened by the problems that arise in our increasingly secular, pluralistic society. People are abandoning truth, Western culture is dying, and the lines between right and wrong are becoming irrevocably blurred.\n\nThe goal of this event is to allow two prominent voices in the public square -- one Jewish (Prager), and one evangelical Christian (Ravi) -- to engage in an open, honest and entertaining dialogue about these challenges we face as a nation and civilization. This is about asking and answering tough questions in a God-honoring and purposeful way.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBible Prophecy Makes Fools of Many:\nThe brethren in Christ need to begin using common sense when trying to interpret biblical prophecy.  Many false prophets have been exposed over time and many more have yet to surface.  So many Christians today jump at various prophetic interpretations merely because they sound nice but fail to investigate the scriptures, themsleves, for proper understanding of interpretations.  As a result, many are being deceived simply because they do not verify these prophetic interpretations with the scriptures that identify them.\n\nIt has not been long ago that communism would give us Antichrist. Then it was the European Union. Now it is Islam! It appears that what or whoever is the evil champ of the day is the candidate for the job. How long will you allow yourself to be influenced by foolishness? Learn to think for yourself.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDeclaring the End in the Beginning - Passover (Pesach):\nSaturday April 19, 2014.  This is a fantastic presentation that shows how God has declared His knowledge of the end of times way back in the beginning of times.  In the beginning found in Genesis throughout the remaining books, God provides His knowledge.  Travel along as we progress throught the scripture and link these wonderful events together.\n\n(AKJV) Exodus 33:1 And the LORD said to Moses, Depart, and go up hence, you and the people which you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed will I give it:\n\n(AKJV) Exodus 33:2,3a And I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: To a land flowing with milk and honey:\n\n(AKJV) Exodus 33:3b-5a for I will not go up in the middle of you; for you are a stiff necked people: lest I consume you in the way. And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You are a stiff necked people: I will come up into the middle of you in a moment, and consume you:\n\n(AKJV) Exodus 33:7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that everyone which sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCircles and Ladders:\nMonday March 31, 2014; Frank Seekins discusses the Circles and Ladders often found in marriages and how to properly interpret them.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Books of Ruth and Revelation:\nBrother David Valance filling in for Pastor Lawson at Temple Baptist Church in Knoxville Tenn. SS 01/12/14\nwww.thelionofjudah.org\nSons of Thunder, Old Time Preaching on face book\nTitus 3:5\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Blood, The Church, &amp; the Revelation:\nPastor Charles Lawson of Temple Baptist Church in Knoxville Tenn. SM 01/12/14\nwww.thelionofjudah.org\nSons of thunder, Old Time Preaching on face book\nTitus 3:5\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe gods of Babylon:\nThe for the ancient city of Babylon as the birth place of a mystery religion which has survived to the present day and is deceiving the whole world. In this presentation we examine the origins of this mystery religion and see how it survives and thrives in the form of secret symbols and false systems of worship. See how this ancient mystery religion reveals the identity of the Antichrist power that is alive and well in the world today and which is directing world events for its own purposes. Will you be deceived into receiving &quot;the mark of the beast&quot;? Watch this presentation and arm yourself with the truth so that you will not be deceived!\n\nAlso learn what the Bible reveals about the nature of God? Is God a mysterious unity of three co-equal and co-eternal Persons as most Christians believe? Who or what is the Holy Spirit? Is there is a reason why there is so much confusion about the nature and identity of the Holy Spirit? Is our God the Author of confusion? Or is it possible instead that most Christians have simply been deceived about the nature of God having its origins tied to ancient pagan mysticism and not the Bible?\n\nDiscover the knowledge of man being made in God's image and how it clearly reveals His loving nature. The bible makes it easy to understand, but man has turned God's nature into something mysterious and confusing. Either misinterpreting or misrepresenting God's truth, man has continued to cling to the teachings of Tradition rather than accept these simple truths contained in the Bible.\n\nAs Christians, we must accept God for who He is: a loving and righteous, eternal and everlasting God. In turn, we must accept the bible as His holy word containing all truth for us to learn and grow in His holy image. It must be Sola Scriptura with no adding nor deleting of God's truths in scripture. The wise must be prudent in understanding these details and not let themselves be deceived by the pagan traditions embraced by the church which is leading the world into the end of days.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAl Qaeda Expands, Israel Perseveres - February 4, 2014:\nOn this week's edition of &quot;The Watchman,&quot; we analyze the global growth of Al Qaeda and its affiliates in the face of Obama administration denials. Plus, we sit down with Jerusalem-based author Lela Gilbert to discuss her new book, ...\n\nNote that in this discussion on Israel there is an extreme coorelation between Israel and the modern church.  Both accept anf somewhat fear God, but neither are willing to fully give themselves over to full obedience in His righteous ways.  Whether because they simply don't feel some laws are necessary or worthy to follow, or just too hard to uphold.  Regardless the EXCUSE, both have been lacking the repetence to counter the rebelliousness within their communities and God is giving them over to the Heaven.  Please wise up and listen to &quot;those with ears, let them hear.&quot;  Time is running out with God's patience for His people.  Soon things will explode (Psalms 83) followed by a few decades of troubling times (a woman's labor pains during pregnancy, which has already begun but will soon greatly increase).  Don't be left in the dark and repent.  God's 10 commandments are a reflecting of His eternal word and character, stop pretending otherwise and get into His good graces before its too late!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso included in this download are...\nThe Sermon in Luke by shieldoftheson\nJeremiah 20 by David Wilkerson\nSigns - Part 52:\nA folder compiled of various short clips presenting recent apocalyptic signs occurring around the world today and help us identify the state of affairs ushering the end of days.
