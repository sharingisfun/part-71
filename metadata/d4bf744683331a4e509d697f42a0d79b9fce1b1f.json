Doyle (Author, Illustrator)\n\n\nDuring his life Patrick has seen and heard things he can t explain. Finding answers to these mysteries is the driving force in his research of the paranormal. While camped out in the mountains for months, cut off from the distractions of the everyday world, his imagination was allowed to explore new thoughts and ideas. In the silence of starlit nights he came to the realization that less of his time needed to be spent trying to prove the existence of ghosts. More important was the need to explore the unanswered questions: What are ghosts and how can they do what they do? This book is a collection of theories aimed at these two questions, personal encounters, tales from the mountain, and his investigation notes taken during a once-in-a-lifetime adventure in an underground haunted by tragedy, greed and death.\n\nEPUB and PDF\n\nIf you loved Ghost mine you will love this book\n\nEnjoy \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4bf744683331a4e509d697f42a0d79b9fce1b1f","amp;dn":"Ghosts+from+the+ground+up","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4bf744683331a4e509d697f42a0d79b9fce1b1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,191,116,70,131,51,26,78,80,157,105,127,66,160,215,155,159,206,27,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
