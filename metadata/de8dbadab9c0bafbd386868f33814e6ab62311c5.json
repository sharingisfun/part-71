With the challenges faced while working with children, it is easy to end up in a rut of go-to poses. The book counters the stock image effect with its broad variety of creative options, and incorporates experience-based knowledge on achieving successful results, such as creating a comforting zone for the child or the potential assistance of integrated props. The poses highlight what the parents love to see while considering what will work with even the most willful of young subjects.\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de8dbadab9c0bafbd386868f33814e6ab62311c5","amp;dn":"500+Poses+for+Photographing+Infants+and+Toddlers+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de8dbadab9c0bafbd386868f33814e6ab62311c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,141,186,218,185,192,186,251,211,134,134,143,51,129,78,106,182,35,17,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
