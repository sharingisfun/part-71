Naruto and his group stop at one of the smaller islands off the coast of the Land of Water for restocking before going straight to the Land of Lightning. Naruto sets off to eat. Akatsuchi is sent by the Tsuchikage to the same isolated island in the Land of Water to rendezvous with ChÃ…ï¿½jÃ…Â«rÃ…ï¿½, and Kurotsuchi tags along. As they await, they're attacked by a group of Kirigakure ninja, led by GanryÃ…Â«. Battle ensues and Akatsuchi is injured. Naruto and ChÃ…ï¿½jÃ…Â«rÃ…ï¿½ interfere and stop the battle. ChÃ…ï¿½jÃ…Â«rÃ…ï¿½ demands GanryÃ…Â« and his team to withdraw, stating that they are violating the Mizukage's will. The team leaves, and Kurotsuchi argues with ChÃ…ï¿½jÃ…Â«ro to tend Akatsuchi's injuries, who says they need to wait for a medical-nin. ChÃ…ï¿½jÃ…Â«rÃ…ï¿½ explains those were ninja who oppose the Allied Shinobi Forces, GanryÃ…Â« being the sole survivor of the Tragedy of Yosuga Pass. Kurotsuchi heads out to kill GanryÃ…Â« before he can kill her. Naruto however, stops Kurotsuchi from fatally injuring GanryÃ…Â«, telling GanryÃ…Â« that it will just create a cycle of hatred. Kurotsuchi attempts to slash GanryÃ…Â« using her sword, but Naruto blocks it with his body. GanryÃ…Â« agrees to let Naruto fulfil the peace. ChÃ…ï¿½jÃ…Â«ro arrives with other Kiri ninja, telling GanryÃ…Â« to surrender, which he does. ChÃ…ï¿½jÃ…Â«ro informs him that the Iwa messenger was sent by the Tsuchikage himself, to formally apologise for the Tragedy of Yogusa Pass, and return a personal belonging of one of GanryÃ…Â«'s team-mates who was killed in it. ChÃ…ï¿½jÃ…Â«ro tells the others that GanryÃ…Â« won't be sentenced for execution. Akatsuchi then tells Kurotsuchi that Kiri will just owe Iwa a favour in the future to come. Delighted that the Iwa-Kiri grudge has come to an end, Naruto leaves in a hurry, without introducing himself to the others. Once arriving with Yamato and the others, they await for a new ship to take them to the island in the Land of Lightning.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0334f079c6984ac95e5536a7e9dd0297f21bb6f","amp;dn":"%5BM%40nI%5D+Naruto+Shippuden%2FShippuuden+242+720p+%28Dual+Audio%29+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0334f079c6984ac95e5536a7e9dd0297f21bb6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,51,79,7,156,105,132,172,149,229,83,106,126,157,208,41,127,33,187,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
