Undeservedly forgotten.\n\n\npolitically incorrect and turgid back cover description:\n\nPushed around the streets of Dublin by his boisterous brothers, the small crippled occupant of a boxcar is a silent witness of the city's joys and woes. Fully possessed of the thoughts and feelings of his sprawling family, he is the focal figure of the novel which relates his searing childhood and coming of age. At once tormented and relaxed, he is the detached observer of life in the slums of forties and fifties Dublin.\n\nWritten with the fearless discipline that Christy Brown had to establish over his own body, Down All the Days displays his lyrical gift with language to the full.\n\n'Will surely stand beside Joyce and in front of all the others as Dublin writ large and writ for all times.' -- Irish Times\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1da4334b918bfa49af1bbe34a18be024c4f0f0c","amp;dn":"Christy+Brown+-+Down+All+the+Days+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1da4334b918bfa49af1bbe34a18be024c4f0f0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,218,67,52,185,24,191,164,154,241,187,227,74,24,190,2,76,79,15,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
