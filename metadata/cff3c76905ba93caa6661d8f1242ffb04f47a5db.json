GNOME 3 modern desktop is the default GDM option, but users who do not wish to switch to the GNOME 3 GUI and desktop features, would want to switch to the GNOME Classic. GNOME Classic is the desktop environment targeted to users who prefer more traditional desktop experience. While based on GNOME 3 technologies, it provides the Applications and Places menus on the top bar, and a window list at the bottom of the screen. Last, but not least, we're presenting our own 'GNOME FallBack' mode.&quot; Read the rest of the release announcement for more details.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cff3c76905ba93caa6661d8f1242ffb04f47a5db","amp;dn":"Rosa+Fresh+2012+R2+Gnome+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cff3c76905ba93caa6661d8f1242ffb04f47a5db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,243,199,105,5,186,147,202,166,102,29,143,18,66,255,176,79,71,165,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
