In that same year, 1993, I started a small school in the barn behind my house in Rockland, Maine. I believe that the publication of the book was responsible for the early success of the school,...&quot;\n&quot;As the years have progressed, the Center for Furniture Craftsmanship has become a far more vibrant and comprehensive school than I could ever have imagined in those early days. Fortunately, with all the work of growing and running a school, I continue to have the opportunity to teach the Basic Woodworking course on which this text is based. As the course has evolved over time, the need for a revised version of the text has grown.&quot;\n\nFrom the Introduction:\n&quot;THIS BOOK EVOLVED from the Basic Woodworking workshop that I began teaching in 1981 and still teach to this day. Class participants range from absolute beginners to experienced woodworkers who are competent with machinery but still need to master the hand skills so essential to fine craftsmanship. Like the course, this book presents indispensable information on wood characteristics, joinery, and tools, and then leads you through a series of projects that build upon one another sequentially. We begin by milling a piece of wood foursquare and end with construction of a handsome side table that incorporates a drawer and a frame-and-panel door.&quot;\n\nFront cover &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/f0d18062434d3c76c1d321a2eb9216fe20f06119.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/f0d18062434d3c76c1d321a2eb9216fe20f06119.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nBack cover &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/1776d8014a31545cadc8a9a1f0c9200a2c0b89d1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/1776d8014a31545cadc8a9a1f0c9200a2c0b89d1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nTable of Contents &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/e2402c3066144331927011ed4b3ff81210f8d8aa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/e2402c3066144331927011ed4b3ff81210f8d8aa.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nSample page &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/d0058734c5f1604da4edf3b1dd3f9253c7157b1c.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/d0058734c5f1604da4edf3b1dd3f9253c7157b1c.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA beautiful book about a beautiful craft.
