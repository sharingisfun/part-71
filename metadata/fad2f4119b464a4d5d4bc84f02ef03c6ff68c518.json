We'll cover methods for getting geometry into Mudbox, how to transform it around the scene, and subdivide it in preparation for sculpting. We'll proceed from there by using a project based approach to create an action figure complete with packaging as we cover the sculpting and painting tools.\n\nWe'll talk about changing our tool properties to get different results and using stamps and stencils to create various looks. We'll use sculpt layers to add detail in a very flexible way and create a custom Vector Displacement Map to quickly repeat sculpted detail. We'll go over some on-target presentation features in Mudbox and move on to painting textures.\n\nWe'll cover Mudbox's paint layer functionality and learn to project detail from images onto our models. We'll also talk about features like retopologizing meshes, the Pose tools, and working with multiple paint layers and channels. We'll finish up by talking about how Mudbox integrates with other applications like Maya, 3ds Max, and Softimage.\n\nThis training will give you the chance to learn the ins and outs of Mudbox by going through the process with a project based approach. As you follow along, project files will be provided and you can either follow exactly or feel free to customize your project to fit your own design. Once you're finished, if you'd like to go deeper with any topic, we have a wide range of Mudbox tutorials to choose from.
