It is based on the excellent Slacko Puppy 5.6.5, and uses LXDE as a desktop environment.  There are three different versions this release cycle: Netbook, Desktop and X.\n\nNetbook 14.4 is designed to be fast and light, for people who just want an OS, a browser, and not much else.  It comes with Chrome as the default browser (Firefox is available  in the package manager) and on the fully customisable dock you can also access mplayer for playing media files (VLC is available in the package manager).  It is 246.2mb and can be downloaded from here.\n\nDesktop 14.4 is designed to be a more heavyweight Linux.  It also uses the LXDE desktop environment, and comes preinstalled with Dropbox, Chrome, Skype, LibreOffice, Thunderbird, and a more refined audio mixer.  All these applications are available from the dock, making access easy.  More applications are available via the application finder, and a large range of applications can be installed from the package manager.  It also includes a range of (in our opinion) beautiful wallpapers which can be found in the Wallpaper directory.  It is  562.8mb and can be downloaded from here.\n\nX 14.4 is our experimental release.  It uses KDE, and comes with Chrome, LibreOffice, Skype, Dropbox, and several other applications.  X is not designed for day to day use, it is an experiment to see what can be done with Puppy Linux and if we can take things from this to use in our standard releases.  After careful consideration, we decided not to move X from itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beta form, as whilst there are a few issues (shutdown, icon problems) we think X still performs well.  It is 672.4mb and can be downloaded from here.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using Simplicity Linux 14.4, and for the die hard, bleeding edge users, in a month or so, you can expect to see Simplicity 14.7 Alpha!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06d4c53fbbfd750cd873e5f9fa6b4a5d5c4b29f3","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_Simplicity_Linux_archive_30-Apr-2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06d4c53fbbfd750cd873e5f9fa6b4a5d5c4b29f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,212,197,63,187,253,117,12,216,115,229,249,250,107,74,93,92,75,41,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
