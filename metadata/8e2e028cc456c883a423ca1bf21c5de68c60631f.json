This looks to me as a lost episode from season one; so don't be surprised if the next aired episode also have the same number 9.\n\n\nFormat: x264, MP4.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e2e028cc456c883a423ca1bf21c5de68c60631f","amp;dn":"Beverly.Hills.Pawn.S02E09.McQueen.and.Masquerades.%28Jan.26.2014%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e2e028cc456c883a423ca1bf21c5de68c60631f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,46,2,140,196,86,200,131,164,35,202,27,242,28,93,230,140,96,99,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
