It is the band's first studio album since &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot; (1993), and their first album of original studio material since the simultaneous releases of Use Your Illusion I and II in September 1991. \n\nDespite debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 and being certified Platinum by the RIAA, Chinese Democracy domestically undersold expectations. It received generally mixed to positive reviews from music critics. The album achieved international chart success and has sold over one million copies in Europe.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t \t\n1. \t&quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;   \t4:43\n2. \t&quot;Shackler's Revenge&quot;    3:37\n3. \t&quot;Better&quot;   \t \t4:58\n4. \t&quot;Street of Dreams&quot;   \t4:46\n5. \t&quot;If the World&quot;   \t4:54\n6. \t&quot;There Was a Time&quot;    \t6:41\n7. \t&quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;   \t5:53\n8. \t&quot;Scraped&quot;   \t\t3:30\n9. \t&quot;Riad N' the Bedouins&quot;  4:10\n10. \t&quot;Sorry&quot;   \t\t6:14\n11. \t&quot;I.R.S.&quot;   \t\t4:28\n12. \t&quot;Madagascar&quot;   \t        5:38\n13. \t&quot;This I Love&quot;   \t5:34\n14. \t&quot;Prostitute&quot;   \t \t6:15\n\nTotal length:                   71:18\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77a3e6b3dcfbac9502bbda9bac2f1be6fca14b3f","amp;dn":"Guns+N+Roses+-+%282008%29+Chinese+democracy+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77a3e6b3dcfbac9502bbda9bac2f1be6fca14b3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,163,230,179,220,251,172,149,2,187,218,155,172,47,27,230,252,161,75,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
