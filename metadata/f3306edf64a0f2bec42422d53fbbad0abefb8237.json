When Colpix's New York head Paul Wexler heard the demos he said they were the worst he'd ever heard and flat refused to waste any money on the duo.  Tony Owen, Donna Reed's husband and producer of the show, put up the money himself to produce Shelly Fabares's first recordings.  &quot;Johnny Angel&quot; went straight to #21 in 1962 and follow-up &quot;Johnny Loves Me&quot; made #21 in the same year.\n\nTrack List:\n\n   1.
