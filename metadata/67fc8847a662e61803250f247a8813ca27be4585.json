He wrote/produced/played for the bands Fridaythe13th and Orange Street both of which won the Great Indian Rock(GIR) competition in 2003 and 2005 respectively. After an extensive tour of Europe with Orange Street,  Donn wrote/produced his first solo album &quot;One Way Circle&quot; in 2006 from his bedroom studio in Delhi. The album was well received and is still being passed around in the independent music scene. Two of the songs were featured on the Sahi Bol compilation. The album also got Donn Featured as the BBC Artist of the month on the Bobby Friction show in Mar'2011.More recently three of his Album tracks got featured on the series &quot;Bring On the Night&quot; on MTV. Very recently he completed his second solo album called Passenger Revelator along with composing for Film/TV in Mumbai.\n\nOn the one hand, Bhat's built a reputation as a solid producer, making accessible music that embraces melodrama with uplifting emotion, yet never tipping over the edge. The 'Wild City Mix' however, showcases a midnight raid on the middle ground, combining high drama with glossy production and beefy choruses. An adaptable shapeshifter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and that, with his orotund vocal sound, an instantly recognisable one.\n\nThree Albums included:\n1) One Way Circle\n2) Passenger Revelator (Collaborations)\n3) The Wild City Mix #63\n\nGenre: Indian+Electro+Rock\n\nNote: If you like the artist please support his work!\n\nwww.donnbhat.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67fc8847a662e61803250f247a8813ca27be4585","amp;dn":"Donn+Bhat+Discography+%28Two+Albums+-+One+Way+Circle+%2B+Passenger+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67fc8847a662e61803250f247a8813ca27be4585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,252,136,71,166,98,230,24,3,37,15,36,122,136,19,202,39,190,69,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
