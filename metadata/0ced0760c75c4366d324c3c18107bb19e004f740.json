The Property Brothers come to the rescue and help the couple find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time. With a budget that doesn't match the couple's expectations, Drew and Jonathan struggle to sell the potential of a fixer-upper. The couple decides between two renovation projects, but natural born salesman Dan hampers the negotiations with lowball offers. Once renovations finally begin, his rapid-fire design changes threaten to push Jonathan over the edge. If Jonathan can't rein Dan in, the whole project will slip away.\n\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ced0760c75c4366d324c3c18107bb19e004f740","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s02e16.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ced0760c75c4366d324c3c18107bb19e004f740","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,237,7,96,199,92,67,102,211,36,195,193,129,7,187,25,224,4,247,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
