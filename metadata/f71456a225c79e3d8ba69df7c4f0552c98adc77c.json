Over months a community builds around the illegal blockade as it develops into the Cascadia Free State and similar actions spread across the region. Years after its release, Pickaxe has become a classic document of the potential for grassroots direct action to achieve victory against the forces of both government and big business. Lovingly crafted by the participants themselves, the film expertly presents every moment, from confrontation to celebration. Includes new commentary track by filmmakers Tim Lewis and Tim Ream. [94 min.]\n\nBREAKING THE SPELL\n\nAn hour-long look at the 1999 Seattle WTO protests and the anarchists who traveled there to set a new precedent for militant confrontation, this documentary picks up where Pickaxe left off. Filmed in the thick of the action, including footage that aired nationally on 60 Minutes, it captures a moment when world history was up for grabs. Includes new commentary track by filmmakers Tim Lewis, Tim Ream &amp; Sir Chuck A. Rock. [63 min.]\n\nTHE MIAMI MODEL\n\nAgainst the prescribed template of paramilitary oppression, information warfare, and profit above all values, activists converge in Miami to demonstrate grassroots resistance, creative action, and international solidarityÃ¢â‚¬â€a clash between competing visions of globalization, soon to be known as the Miami Model. Indymedia activists shot hundreds of hours documenting the 2003 FTAA protests in Miami and shaped it into a documentary that cuts through the mass media blackout to reveal the brutal repression and assault on civil liberties that took place, as well as the inspiring alternatives to capitalist globalization that were also in full effect in Miami. [91 min.]\n\nFIVE SHORT FILMS\n\nAn hour of shorts with three documented thinktank experiments and two CrimethInc. essays recreated for the screen by SubMedia.\n\nSafetybike [3 min.]\nHow to Turn a Bicycle into a Record Player (includes original version and new 21st century version) [13 min.]\nAuto Re-Vision (includes new commentary track by participants Mark, Etta &amp; James) [26 min.]\nJoin the Resistance, Fall in Love [17 min.]\nWhy I Love Shoplifting From Big Corporations [5 min.]\n\n-------\n\nThe Clownsec &quot;TruthHz&quot; (Truth Hurts) series is intended to educate the masses on various topics which are swept under the rug. We appreciate the hard work that these film makers have gone through, which is most often unrewarded. These films are a document of history, part of the historical record but ignored by mainstream. If it was not for these filmmakers, this information, and all that you learn from them would be destroyed and forgotten. Dictated by those who carried out the crimes, to cover them up.\n\nAll that being said, many of these documentaries are produced with the instructions to freely distribute, to copy for others, because the information is too valuable to be missed by those who are not fortunate enough to purchase. Often there is special pricing for bulk copies, or specialized releases with extra notes from the director, to be copied and given freely. This information should be free for all, but the directors and those involved in creating these great educational works, should also be rewarded. Please take the time to look into this release. See who made it, where it came from, and think long and hard about possibly purchasing more copies for friends, or sending a donation to help motivate the director to keep exposing the truth, and to make further films exposing crimes which are not yet properly documented, leaving the public feeling powerless. Education empowers. You cannot fight something you do not understand. Again, remember that without these directors, this information would be lost down the memory hole or very difficult for the average person to retrieve.\n\n(go buy this, its under 10$ and included all the films, plus a ton of text files, and educational materials. They also send you free stickers and documents etc. with every purchase. WELL worth your 8$)\n\nBROUGHT TO YOU BY CLOWNSEC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f71456a225c79e3d8ba69df7c4f0552c98adc77c","amp;dn":"Crimethinc+Guerilla+Film+Series+Vol+1+%281999-2004%29+480p+DVDRip+x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f71456a225c79e3d8ba69df7c4f0552c98adc77c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,20,86,162,37,199,158,61,139,166,157,247,196,240,85,44,152,173,199,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
