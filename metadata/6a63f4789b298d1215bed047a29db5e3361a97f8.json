Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tx.) said it would be considered &quot;the worst prison break in American history, except it was sanctioned by the president and perpetrated by our own immigration officials.&quot; \n\nJoining today's show is economic forecaster and author Harry Dent on what people can do to protect themselves from a future economic collapse. \n\nAlso joining the show are reporters David Knight and SSG Joe Biggs, who are on the scene in Virginia outside Fort A.P. Hill where the U.S. Army built a fake city, including a school and a Baptist church, to practice military occupation.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
