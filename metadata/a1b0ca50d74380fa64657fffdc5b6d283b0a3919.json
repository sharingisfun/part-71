Prince Frederic.Prince Duncan. Prince Gustav. You think you know those guys pretty well by now, don't you? Well, think again. Posters plastered across the thirteen kingdoms are saying that Briar Rose has been murderedÃ¢â‚¬â€and the four Princes Charming are the prime suspects, along with Cinderella, Snow White, Rapunzel, and Lila. Now they're on the run in a desperate attempt to clear their names.\n\nAlong the way, however, they discover that Briar's murder is just one part of a nefarious plot to take control of all thirteen kingdomsÃ¢â‚¬â€a plot that will lead them across the ocean, through a scorching desert, and to the doorstep of an eerily familiar fortress for a final showdown with an eerily familiar enemy.\n\nChristopher Healy returns once again to the fairy-tale world he created for the last installment in his epically humorous history. Giant mongooses will be battled, brain-melting beetles will be run from, dozens of feathers will be plucked, and, perhaps, kingdoms will finally be saved, now and forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1b0ca50d74380fa64657fffdc5b6d283b0a3919","amp;dn":"The+Hero%27s+Guide+To+Being+An+Outlaw+-+Christopher+Healy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1b0ca50d74380fa64657fffdc5b6d283b0a3919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,176,202,80,215,67,128,250,100,101,127,255,220,91,109,40,59,10,57,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
