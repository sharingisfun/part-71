This one has quite a bit of visual style, a precursor to I Walked with a Zombie, however the acting isn't quite as good. Fay Wray you may remember from King Kong. Definitely worth checking out as part of the evolution of the zombie movie.\n\nI also have Black Moon (1975), if anyone is interested.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aefe7f4cc8ebc6c3f3657261a628ee071274d0f","amp;dn":"Black+Moon+%281934%29+Fay+Wray+-+voodoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aefe7f4cc8ebc6c3f3657261a628ee071274d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,239,231,244,204,142,188,108,63,54,87,38,26,98,142,224,113,39,77,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
