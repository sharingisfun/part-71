Finally, the last word on the Sun and pre-Sun blues recordings! Nearly 30 years after the original Sun Blues Box was released on LP, it's back on CD with so much more than was on the original set. Recently discovered music from well-known artists Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and incredible artifacts like Sam Phillips narrating a radio commercial for a West African herbalist who would soon be jailed for selling bogus patent medicine. Recordings produced by Phillips but issued on Chess, RPM, Trumpet and other labels were unavailable in 1983, but are now included. Researcher Steve LaVere finally allowed the world to hear the Sun audio and see the Sun-related photos he collected back in the late 1960s. In fact, the entire blues research community came together to make this a once-in-a-lifetime blues experience!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bear-family.com/en/blues-crosscut/va-sun-blues-box-1950-1958-10-cd-180p-hardcover.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bear-family.com/en/blues-crosscut/va-sun-blues-box-1950-1958-10-cd-180p-hardcover.html&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8562e34e746fb9c4951cf8d2512383ce4cc88722","amp;dn":"VA+-+The+Sun+Blues+Box+%282013%29+%5BMP3+V0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8562e34e746fb9c4951cf8d2512383ce4cc88722","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,98,227,78,116,111,185,196,149,28,248,210,81,35,131,206,76,200,135,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
