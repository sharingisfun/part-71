Fox News Asks If 4 Blood Moons A Sign Of Apocolyptic The End Times\nPastor Mark Biltz - The Significance of the Blood Moons - Updated\nPITN_ Blood Moons and the Biblical Calendar\nWhat Will Happen To Israel In 2014 and 2015 THE 4 BLOOD MOONS\n\n\n  'Blood Moon' -  Lunar Eclipse.\nWith the upcoming lunar tetrad falling on Jewish holidays, some Christians have been discussing whether the event is linked to the Bible's End Time prophecy. Though some Christians strongly believe that this year's 'blood moon' eclipses are linked to a passage in Joel 2:31 that says, &quot;The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come,&quot; other Christians believe that now is not the time for Christ's return.\nThe Rev. Mark Hitchcock, a preacher and biblical prophecy expert in Edmond, Oklahoma told The Oklahomian that he doesn't believe the eclipses are related to Bible prophecy.\n\nHitchcock pointed out that while rare astronimical occurrances can often be read about in the Bible, the upcoming lunar eclipses is not one of them.\n\nIn his recently released book, &quot;Blood Moons Rising: Bible Prophecy, Israel and the Four Blood Moons,&quot; Hitchcock, who serves as senior pastor of Faith Bible Church, explains his stance on the universe's upcoming event.\n\nThe Oklahomian reports that Hitchcock began writing his book because many people were asking him whether the blood moons were linked to prophecy. His colleagues were also overwhelmed with questions about the 'blood moon' eclipses. Hitchcock shared that the growing interest resembled the fascination people placed in the Mayan calendar's end of world prophecy on December 21, 20&quot;The difference in the Mayan calendar idea in 2012 was that it really was kind of outside the Christian world.&quot; However, Hithcock stated, &quot;This is a prediction being made by Christian pastors and Christian teachers.&quot; The Oklahoma-based pastor explained that after examining historical and scriptural information, he believes that &quot;the conclusions they draw on this blood moon prophecy of 2014 and 2015 are not valid.&quot;\n\nHitchcock's book counters another recently written published book by world-renown preacher and televangelist, Rev. John Hagee, whose best-seller also discusses the upcoming lunar quartet.\nIn &quot;Four Blood Moons: Something Is About to Change,&quot; Hagee, senior pastor of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, discussed the point that something important will soon happen involving Israel, because the blood moons, otherwise known as the lunar eclipses, will take place during the Jewish holidays of Passover and The Feast of Tabernacles in 2014 and 2015.\n\nRev. Mark Blitz, of El Shaddai Ministries, which is based in Bonney Lake, Washington, has also lent his voice to the growing debate. He too believes that there are ties between the lunar eclipses and Bible prophecy for Israel.\n\nHowever, Bruce McClure and Deborah Byrd, who write for EarthSky.org, believe that it should come as no surprise that these 'blood moons' would coincide with important Jewish holidays, noting that  the Jewish calendar is, after all, a lunar calendar.\n\n&quot;In any year, it's inevitable that a full moon should fall on or near the feasts of Passover (15 Nissan) and Tabernacles (15 Tishri). Nissan and Tishri are the first and seventh months of the Jewish calendar, respectively,&quot; the site stated.\n\nIt did acknowledge, however, that &quot;It is somewhat ironic that three of these four lunar eclipses are not visible Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even in part Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from Israel.&quot;\n\nThe Archon Invasion\n\nMost religions offer a grand cosmic drama, a metaphysical narrative of conflict that filters down to the worldly realmsÃ¢â‚¬â€with the human soul often as the ultimate battleground. The Gnostics had their own spiritual epic, and presented perhaps the most intriguing yet menacing villains in all religious annals: The Archons.\n\nThe word Ã¢â‚¬Å“archonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sounds poetic, echoing some sci-fi antagonist perhaps, but the word simply comes from the Greek for Ã¢â‚¬Å“rulerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“prince,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with a mostly secular connotation. Yet the Apostle Paul in his epistles uses Ã¢â‚¬Å“archonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in a transcendental context (Ephesians 2:2 and Colossians 2:15 are two examples). Through a more esoteric reading, Paul indicates that it was demonic agents, not the Jews or Romans, who were actually responsible for the death of Jesus Christ; and that these very same forces control the universe.\n\nThe Gnostics, always the radical innovators and deconstructionists, expanded PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concepts into notion of the Archon (as found in such texts as the Secret Book of John, the Hypostasis of the Archons, and the Gospel of Judas). In fact, they took the notion to terrifying new vistas, proposing that the god of the Old Testament and his angels were nothing but ArchonsÃ¢â‚¬â€mighty but flawed deities that managed the cosmos and suppressed the forces of good by drowning existence under waves of ignorance and bureaucracy of all sorts.\n\nThe ArchonsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ main task was to keep the lost sparks of the true divinity, contained in all humans, trapped in the material dimensions in order to fuel their own power (the Gnostic-themed movie The Matrix comes to mind).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1de705d53d9ab3d9c719283107f3324b3a4c28b","amp;dn":"B+I+B+L+E+-+L+I+E+S+-+Part+11+-+The+Real+Truth+-+The+Blood+Moons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1de705d53d9ab3d9c719283107f3324b3a4c28b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,222,112,93,83,217,171,61,156,113,146,131,16,127,51,36,179,164,194,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
