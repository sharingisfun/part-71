The Property Brothers come to the rescue and help the couple find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time. With a budget that doesn't match the couple's expectations, Drew and Jonathan set out to sell the potential of a fixer-upper. The couple decides between two renovation projects, and the brothers have just six weeks to do the job. When a freak storm floods the main living space and ruins their vintage hardwood flooring, the happy-go-lucky couple get emotional and demand that Jonathan do whatever it takes to save it. Though Jonathan respects their love of original character, the halt in production threatens his schedule and their budget. Unless he can work some magic, no one is going to be happy.\n\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:684f00459685251b809d23592231aa05aa1dc97f","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s02e15.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"684f00459685251b809d23592231aa05aa1dc97f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,79,0,69,150,133,37,27,128,157,35,89,34,49,170,5,170,29,201,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
