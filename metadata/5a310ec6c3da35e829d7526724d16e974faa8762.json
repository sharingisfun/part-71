He has been a basement- dweller, gallery troll, and a purveyor of forbidden notions. Originally distributed into the world as Xeroxed pamphlets, these Ã¢â‚¬Å“underground comixÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reflect the true nature of its nomenclature: Here are the archeological findings of the subterranean ruins of the psyche. Finally, these scattered elements have been compiled into a compact, lushly illustrated bedside reader. Give your cerebellum a tug and become a spelunker of the subconscious as we trespass among the scorched archaic wastelands of the offspring of apes and fools. Here we find the profane, beautiful progeny of prurient ideals. Immerse yourself in the nocturnal meanderings of unnamed protagonists. Ponder the uncomfortable sexuality of the twins, Cochlea &amp; Eustachia. Recoil at the doings of a dwarfish malefactor in Hail Jeffrey, or simply stare at the pretty pictures. Suffice to say that readers of The Squirrel Machine will not be disappointed.\n\nThe author instructs you not misuse this tome. Poke it gently with a long stick, if you must. Careful, it might ruin the carpet. Placate it with a belly-rub or sweet pastry before it attacks the children. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry, your tongue wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stick. If it fits, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t shove it in too quickly. Keep it as your own cherished object; a shameful, guarded secret. The filter for realityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blinding glare. Detritus of the Under-Brain. The Unspeakable Thing You Always Knew.\n\nFOLLY: The Consequences Of Indiscretion. By one of the most inscrutable and discomforting cartoonists alive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a310ec6c3da35e829d7526724d16e974faa8762","amp;dn":"Hans+Rickheit+-+Folly+Consequences+of+Indiscretion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a310ec6c3da35e829d7526724d16e974faa8762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,49,14,198,195,218,53,232,41,215,82,103,36,209,110,151,79,170,135,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
