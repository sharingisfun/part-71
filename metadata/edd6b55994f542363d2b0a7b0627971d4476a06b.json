For Sheldon, it's difficult because he doesn't\nappear to be the brightest guy in the world (although he\nmight be the funniest). For Colby, it's even more difficult\nbecause he's only 14 years old, and up against enormous odds.\nFor Benji, it's almost impossible--because, after all, he's\njust a dog, lost and alone, with nothing but a belligerent\nbird and a bungling stray mutt to help. A band of unlikely\ncomrades, brought together by the least likely of the bunch,\nfor a common, courageous purpose. Things will change. Lives\nwill be saved.
