Many more to come.\n\nThe Goal?\n\nTo fit all KISS audio onto one (or 2) 64gb usb stick(s) in LOSSLESS wave format (16/44100).\n\nTo find the best possible quality sources for material.\n\nTo present the material as close as possible to it's original, natural intent.\n\nTo make sure all songs are uniform in volume, left to right stereo panning perfectly even, and all tracks speed and pitch corrected.\n\nThe Ultimate Goal? THE definitve KISS audio collection.\n\nThe idea for this project came about 3 years ago when I was fed up with brickwalled cd's and scratched, skipping cdr's in my car, and the constant changing of discs. Now that usb ports are possible in almost every thing we use elctronically, including our vehicles, the project was a no brainer for me. With that said, I know it is not perfect. But, please enjoy.\n\nI've included all cover scans where possible.\n\n\nI enjoyed listening to part 1 of this project very much. What made it most enjoyable for me, was having uniform volume throughout, with the ability to flip from track to track in any random order. \nSo I figured, why not start adding the most popular, and/or best sounding KISS bootlegs? \nIt's not the easiest task balancing random bootlegs, spanning a 40 year career, with their studio album counterparts.\n\nI &quot;tweaked&quot; ALL shows to MY LIKING and I feel many of these shows sound better than ever!!!!. Some examples: Providence 75, Fresno 79, Paris and Wembley 80, Ipswich 84. Stereo balanced and leveled them to flow as well as I could. It's not perfect, nor can it ever be:)\n\n\n\n-1977 Cobo Arena - 12 tracks\n-1977 San Francisco - 16 tracks\n-1977 The Summit nite 2 - 17 tracks\n-1979 Fresno - 16 tracks\n-1980 Sydney - 17 tracks\n-1980 Paris - 16 tracks\n-1980 Wembley Stadium - 19 tracks\n-1980 Auckland - 17 tracks\n-1984 Albuquerque - 18 tracks\n-1984 Nashville - 19 tracks\n-1984 Nashville (King Biscuit) - 7 tracks\n-1984 Ipswich - 11 tracks\n-1985 Animalize Uncensored - pitch adjusted down 1/2 step to KISS more common/natural tuning. Slows the songs down just enough to make them not sound like speed freaks, but still paced enough for the high energy concert -  18 tracks\n-1985 Houston - 17 tracks\n-1985 Charlotte - 14 tracks\n-1987 St. Paul - 18 tracks\n-1988 Stockholm - 19 tracks\n-1988 The Ritz - 20 tracks\n-1988 Tokyo - 20 tracks\n-1990 Auburn Hills - 21 tracks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21e5f94978a99af733afea187af57d6f6e6de7e4","amp;dn":"KISS+Ultimate+Lossless+Audio+Collection+Additions+Part+2+-+Mick+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21e5f94978a99af733afea187af57d6f6e6de7e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,229,249,73,120,169,154,247,51,175,234,24,122,245,125,111,110,109,231,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
