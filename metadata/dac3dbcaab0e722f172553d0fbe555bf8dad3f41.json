At his best, lead singer/songwriter Jeff Darien has a knack for catchy melodies, which the band delivers crisply. At his worst, he's tied to British Invasion, new wave and jangle-pop cliches. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since Mach Five make these traditional styles sound fresh by playing them without pretension or guilt. That is the key factor in Mach Five's being an enjoyable debut, and once Darien has grown as a songwriter, the band could be a force to reckon with.
