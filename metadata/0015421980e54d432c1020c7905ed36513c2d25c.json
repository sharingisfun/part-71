The group, which lasted from 1977 to 1982, became notable as a cult band during the transition from the punk rock era to the post-punk and New Wave era and were noted for their high camp and overtly sexualised stage performances and use of Burundi drums. One line-up of musicians - Dave Barbarossa, Matthew Ashman and Leigh Gorman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ left the band in January 1980 at the suggestion of then-de facto manager Malcolm McLaren, to form the instrumentalist personnel of the controversial Bow Wow Wow.\n\n1 Adam And The Ants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Stand And Deliver     3:10  \n2 Adam And The Ants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Kings Of The Wild Frontier     3:54  \n3 Adam And The Ants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Dog Eat Dog     3:09  \n4 Adam Ant Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Wonderful     4:22  \n5 Adam Ant Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Room At The Top     4:43  \n6 Adam Ant Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Apollo 9     3:24  \n7 Adam And The Ants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Cartrouble     3:25  \n8 Adam And The Ants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Friends     3:33  \n9 Adam Ant Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Desperate But Not Serious     3:55  \n10 Adam And The Ants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Prince Charming     3:17  \n11 Adam Ant Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Goody Two Shoes     3:20  \n12 Adam Ant Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Puss 'n' Boots     4:02  \n13 Adam Ant Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Friend Or Foe     3:24  \n14 Adam Ant Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Strip     3:58  \n15 Adam Ant Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Vive Le Rock     3:39  \n16 Adam And The Ants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Zerox     3:46  \n17 Adam And The Ants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Antmusic     3:36  \n18 Adam And The Ants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Deutscher Girls     2:27  \n19 Adam And The Ants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Ant Rap     3:15  \n20 Adam And The Ants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Kick     2:06  \n21 Adam And The Ants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Young Parisians     2:59  \n22 Adam Ant Ã¢â‚¬â€œ   Can't Set Rules About Love     4:42  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0015421980e54d432c1020c7905ed36513c2d25c","amp;dn":"Adam+And+The+Ants+-+The+Very+Best+Of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0015421980e54d432c1020c7905ed36513c2d25c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,21,66,25,128,229,77,67,44,16,32,199,144,94,211,101,19,194,210,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
