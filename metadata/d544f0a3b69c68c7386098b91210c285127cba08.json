This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThe first country cross-over hit in three-and-a-half years is at number 40, &quot;I'll Still Be Loving You&quot; by Restless Heart.\n\nFrom the AT40 book of records, Casey tells about the oldest man to ever hit number one. Born in New Orleans on the 4th of July, this 63 year-old man pushed the Beatles out of their 14 week number one monopoly back in 1964.\n\nThere is a song by the man who voters chose as having the sexiest eyes in the world. He beat out Tom Cruise, Frank Sinatra, and Paul Newman.\n\nJody Whatley is at number 12 with &quot;Looking For A New Love.&quot; Casey tells how she got her break when a group that didn't exist suddenly had to.   \n\nCasey answers the most asked question AT40 ever got, &quot;Have any records ever dropped from the number one spot, then come back and hit number one again?&quot; There were 33 such hits, but Casey plays parts of the only two songs to hit number one THREE times.\n\n40:    I'll Still Be Loving You - Restless Heart    \n39:    The Finer Things - Steve Winwood\n38:    Endless Nights - Eddie Money\n37:    Sweet Sixteen - Billy Idol    \n36:    Every Little Kiss - Bruce Hornsby &amp; The Range\n35:    Shakedown - Bob Seger\n34:    Don't Dream It's Over - Crowded House\n33:    Something So Strong - Crowded House\n32:    Point Of No Return - Expose    \n31:    Heartbreak Beat - Psychedelic Furs\n30:    Jammin' Me - Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers\n29:    Se La - Lionel Richie\n28:    Don't Disturb This Groove - The System\n27:    Alone - Heart\nLDD:   Stand By Me - Ben E.
