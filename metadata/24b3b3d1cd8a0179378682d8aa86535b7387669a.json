I work for him everyday possible, Not just 1 day a week.\n\nWhy I'm a Sabbath Keeping Christian?\nPastor Dan Jarrard, after decades of administering Baptist Sunday keeping worship, experienced a life-changing experience while researching the Bible. Was the Sabbath created for the Jews only?  When was the law given and is it important to us now?  What does history show us?  Find out in our first installment in our 4 part seminar: &quot;Why I Am A Sabbath-keeping Christian&quot;.  Learn the truth of history and the devil's assualt on the word of God and His Sabbath day commandment.\n\nThis download contains the following videos and mp3 formats ...\n\n&quot;The Sabbath: Kept In The Beginning&quot; - Pastor Dan Jarrard\n&quot;The Sabbath: Kept By Jesus&quot; - Pastor Dan Jarrard\n&quot;The Sabbath: Kept By The Apostles&quot; - Pastor Dan Jarrard\n&quot;The Sabbath: Kept By The Early Church&quot; - Pastor Dan Jarrard\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.
