Boasting true HD video and surround sound audio, this 11-disc set is the finest version of Wagner's magnum opus available as a torrent.  \n\nA technical note in the accompanying booklet (scanned and included in the torrent) warns that there are occasional &quot;disturbing distortions&quot; in the first 25 minutes of Das Rheingold, caused during recording by the on-stage lasers.  This was noticed during filming, but it was too late to fix it.  I did notice some distortions, but they do not impede viewing or ruin the experience.\n\n\nRemember, the arts need your support!  Buy works you enjoy, and attend local performances.
