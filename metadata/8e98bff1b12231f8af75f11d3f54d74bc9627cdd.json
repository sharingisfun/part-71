Bob has been featured in The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Financial Times, Glamour, Marie Claire, and other major publications. International Network TV reports have included Brazil, Germany, Norway, France, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, and others. Bob is also the author of 32 books, including LarsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Book of Spiritual Warfare, LarsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Book of World Religions, Demon Proofing Prayers, and four, non-fiction novels. His latest book is entitled Curse Breaking: Freedom from the Bondage of Generational Sin.\n\nAuthor\n\nBob has written 31 books, translated into more than a dozen languages. His books include four best-selling novels, Dead Air, Abaddon and The SenatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Agenda, and Shock Talk. His 500-page handbook, LarsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Book of Spiritual Warfare is an encyclopedic reference about demons, the devil, and deliverance and represents a lifetime of research and experience. His 500-page classic work LarsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Book of Cults is a standard reference encyclopedia at many colleges and seminaries. LarsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality is a 575-page survey of cults and major religious movements. Other books include: Straight Answers on the New Age, Satanism: the Seduction of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Youth, In the Name of Satan, UFOs and the Alien Agenda and Extreme Evil: Kids Killing Kids. His latest book is entitled Demon Proofing Prayers.\n\nRadio\n\nFor 20 years, Bob hosted a nationally syndicated radio talk show, Ã¢â‚¬Å“TALK-BACK with Bob Larson,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which was heard coast-to-coast across the U.S. and Canada. The two-hour program, broadcast weekdays live-by-satellite, featured tough topics others wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t touch. BobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incisive views on current events were enhanced by a format of live callers and riveting guests.\n\nReality Television\n\nBobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest effort in television is Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Real Exorcist,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a reality TV show in which he stars as a real-life exorcist. The show showcases his spiritual quest to battle the devil around the world. Originally commissioned by the UKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Virgin Media, and shot by Pilgrim Films, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Real ExorcistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ features two dramatic exorcism episodes per each one-hour show. It premiered in the U.S. on the Sci-Fi Channel in Fall 2008 and has since aired internationally. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Real ExorcistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ series follows Rev. Bob and his team on their quest to save people from their possessions. In some cases, the possession has existed since the victims were children, resulting from very dark and traumatic experiences. In other cases the initial possession will be more difficult to identify as seemingly healthy, normal people have changed personality in a very short time span. In either case, the transformation is horrific and incredibly painful for the person who has been possessed. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Real ExorcistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is gripping and shocking television Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you will be glued to the screen, not wanting to miss a thing! Whether you are a true believer or a skeptic, it is indisputable that Reverend Larson has a tremendous impact on the people whom he exorcises. He is currently working on a brand new reality show to be aired soon.\n\nSpiritual Freedom Seminars\n\nBob draws upon his more than 30 years of experience investigating the occult to reveal how evil influences peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives. Unlike the Hollywood version of the occult, BobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seminars feature the supernatural center-stage without smoke and mirrors! He teaches his audiences about the many ways that evil attacks human beings. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The devil traffics in human suffering,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bob explains, Ã¢â‚¬Å“and we take people to the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpoint of the painÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to discover where their souls have been scarred, allowing Satan to torment them. Exorcism is often part of the healing process that follows.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nDo What Jesus Did Teams\n\nGod has given Bob Larson a vision to raise up Do What Jesus Did (DWJD) Spiritual Freedom Teams to fulfill the mission of Christ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“preach the Gospel, heal the brokenhearted, and set the captives freeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Luke 4:18). DWJD teams have been established in more than 100 cities worldwide, and new teams are forming every week. These emotional healing and deliverance teams are comprised of lay people who volunteer their time to bring hope to the desperate victims of abuse and spiritual bondage. Teams are also being planted in many foreign countries, including Canada, the Caribbean, England, Australia, Africa, New Zealand, Europe and Eastern Europe.\n\nPersonal Coaching\n\nBob has developed a one-on-one, 12-step program of spiritual discovery and development which he teaches on an individual basis. These sessions consist of a weekly, 30-minute personal phone call from Bob. He also offers special full-day and half-day Intervention Intensive sessions for those needing urgent, personal assistance. In seminar cities he also offers one-hour, one-on-one sessions called Encounters, in-depth spiritual evaluations. For the business community, he presents a specially adapted 7-step Take Your Life Back program of personal growth addressing health, habits, emotions, relationships, spirituality, vocation, and finances. Other programs include a three-day family Evaluation, a two-day CouplesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Evaluation, and a Pre-Marital Encounter.
