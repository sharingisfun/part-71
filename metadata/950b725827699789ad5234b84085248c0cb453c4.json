Would he have returned to straight-ahead bop, or would the slick, heavily produced smooth jazz he turned to during the last few years of his life continue to be his primary focus? Would there have been any Montgomery Brothers reunions in the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70s? One can only speculate. But what we can say for certain is that when he was still bop-oriented, the influential guitarist made his mark both as a leader and on sessions he co-led with bassist Monk Montgomery and pianist/vibist Buddy Montgomery. The Montgomery Brothers' pre-Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s output is the focus of The Montgomeryland Sessions; spanning 1955-1959, this two-CD set contains the albums The Montgomery Brothers Plus Five Others and Montgomeryland in their entirety. Also included are live performances from the Kismet album (recorded at the Forum Theater in Los Angeles in 1958) and Jon Hendricks' A Good Git-Together (which finds The Montgomery Brothers backing that risk-taking singer at Fugazi Hall in San Francisco in 1959). And collectors will be glad to know that this double-CD contains a rare Montgomery Brothers version of Cole Porter's &quot;Love for Sale&quot; from 1955. The Montgomeryland Sessions isn't the last word on Wes Montgomery's recordings with his brothers; for example, this release doesn't get into their Groove Yard session of 1961. But it takes more than a superficial look at their late-Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ50s activities, and even though The Montgomeryland Sessions isn't recommended to casual listeners, it's a release that serious collectors will be glad to have.\n\nTracklist\n\nA1 Monk's Shop\nA2 Summertime\nA3 Falling In Love\nA4 Renie\nB1 Far Wes\nB2 Leila\nB3 Old Folks\nB4 Wes' Tune\n\nCredits\n\nAlto Saxophone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pony Poindexter\nDrums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Louis Hayes (tracks: tracks 1~4), Tony Bazley (tracks: tracks 5~11)\nElectric Bass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Monk Montgomery\nGuitar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wes Montgomery\nPiano Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Buddy Montgomery\nTenor Saxophone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Harold Land (tracks: tracks 5~11)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:950b725827699789ad5234b84085248c0cb453c4","amp;dn":"%7B24+96%7D+Wes+Montgomery+-+Montgomeryland+1960+%7Bvinyl%7D+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"950b725827699789ad5234b84085248c0cb453c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,11,114,88,39,105,151,137,173,82,52,184,64,133,36,140,12,180,83,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
