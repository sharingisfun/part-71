Muso provides an alternative front end to your music player and allows you to experience a more meaningful interaction with your music collection.\n\nWhat muso isn't\nMuso is not a music player or playlist manager. There are many of these available already, with great features like wireless streaming to your hi-fi, bit-perfect output, graphic equalisers, stunning visualisers, smart playlists, and a myriad of plugins. Muso is not trying to compete with these, but muso can be used to queue music to your favourite player. Currently we are supporting the following players:\n\nLogitech Squeezebox devices - this is muso's preferred solution for streaming music to your hi-fi.\nWinamp - Winamp is muso's preferred solution when you want to play your music directly on your PC.\niTunes - iTunes will continue to be your music player but muso will take over as a browser and as your music database. You can import your existing database from iTunes as a starting point for muso.\nFoobar2000 - beta test functionality only (eg. no feedback of Now Playing status information).\n\nInstall using setup.\nUse Keygen to generate valid license.\nRead Install.txt for instructions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:000175d42bbb80cf778ebe63fe696b199fd5c546","amp;dn":"muso.v2.0.17.1.Incl.Keygen-BEAN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"000175d42bbb80cf778ebe63fe696b199fd5c546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,1,117,212,43,187,128,207,119,142,190,99,254,105,107,25,159,213,197,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
