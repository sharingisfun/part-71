It is based on the DC Comics character Green Arrow, a costumed crime-fighter who was created by Mort Weisinger and George Papp. It premiered in North America on The CW on October 10, 2012, with international broadcasting taking place in late 2012. The series follows billionaire playboy Oliver Queen, portrayed by Stephen Amell, who, after five years of being stranded on a hostile island, returns home to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. Unlike in the comic books, Oliver does not go by the alias &quot;Green Arrow&quot; in the television series. Arrow also features appearances by other DC Comics characters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0b7f4f6084f375eb72f4ef4e3764bdef860c1b6","amp;dn":"Arrow+Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0b7f4f6084f375eb72f4ef4e3764bdef860c1b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,183,244,246,8,79,55,94,183,47,78,244,227,118,75,222,248,96,193,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
