Born in Vicenza, Italy, Baggio started playing football seriously at the age of nine years. After signing to his local football team, and picking up plaudits along the way, he moved to Fiorentina, making many appearances in the European Cup and Italian Cup matches. Baggio later signed to Juventus FC for a record-breaking $17 million, and also took part in the Italian World Cup in Italy in 1990, and in the 1994 World Cup. In 1995 Baggio moved to AC Milan, and was then signed to Bologna FC in 1997. In the 1998/99 season he was bought by Inter Milan, and then in 2000 Baggio signed with Brescia. This is Roberto Baggio's fascinating story...
