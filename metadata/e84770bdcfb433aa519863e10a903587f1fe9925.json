Martin - Patrick D. Martin (1981)\n\nAnother artist that I couldn't find anything out about online. Wiki, Discogs, Allmusic and even blogs that have showcased all or parts of this album have no information about the artist Patrick D. Martin. The &quot;hit&quot; from this album is &quot;I Like 'Lectric Motors&quot;, which had an official video to go along with it (which has been removed fromat this time). The sound is very early 80's synth but primarily upbeat. You'll find other instrumentation sprinkled throughout the 7 tracks (including saxophone on the instrumental 4th track &quot;?&quot;). Based on the credits, Martin is a one-man band. The vocals sound a bit like the UK's Ian Dury, very clearly a Brit.\n\nTRACK LIST:\nA1 Computer Datin' 2:45\nA2 Police Paranoia 3:58\nA3 Press The Button 2:48\nA4 ? 3:31\nB1 I Like 'Lectric Motors 2:25\nB2 Mutant 4:10\nB3 Time\t6:00\n\nCREDITS\nProducer, Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Patrick D.
