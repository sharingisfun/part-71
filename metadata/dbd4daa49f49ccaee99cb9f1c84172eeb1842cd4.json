Dinasaurs still roamed the earth microsoft and apple were still in garages in the prehistoric sillicon valley. The cold war was hot,Starwars was more about the orbital weapons platforms like in that movie \n\nspace Cowboys, Ozzy was out of sabbath and touring with a youngster name of Randy Rhodes,hes pretty good I think hes gonna have a bright future.We did not know who Lukes father was. And Kirk had not Remet Khan, Computers were glorified word processors Fukin junk, No GUI. But we had Heavy Metal,and Lasonic Industrial ghetto boxes,best $200 you would ever spend. ..Anyway..Artists VA Format mp3 Bitrate VBR (no less than 205kbps Yup we Drank,rocked,and partyed,while we waited for them to blow up the outside world.
