I searched online for the whole thing, but all I could find was part 1. Part 2 was nowhere to be found. So I requested the movie from the maker himself, and he sent it to me for free, then I ripped it from the DVD. This is as long as most movies, an hour and a half. \n\nI've seen people on different torrent sites requesting part 2. This contains part 1 and 2.\n\nI recommend this to all animal lovers, as it shows how hard these dogs have it, surviving on the streets. Please, adopt from a shelter instead of buying a dog. Too many shelter dogs (and cats) are killed every year.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nBy the way, this is my first torrent upload ever, so if something is wrong, please give me some tips","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f2c6c933483dd657db1edce488b1af17554585b","amp;dn":"Street+Dogs+Of+South+Central.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f2c6c933483dd657db1edce488b1af17554585b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,44,108,147,52,131,221,101,125,177,237,206,72,139,26,241,117,84,88,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
