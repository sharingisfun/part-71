The goal is to match cards before the timer runs out and don't waste all the remaining turns. Some of the levels move the cards up, down, and some times zoom in an out to test to see if you can follow them. In later levels special cards start to appear that give more time, remaining turns, and allow for the player to see through the cards for a few seconds. \n\nManic Matching contains 50 levels that change the card placement each time the game is played. features an online high scoreboard that allow you to compare your memory against other players from around the world. So come see if your the best. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0ef8026abc358592826e56bc25269316b9eed84","amp;dn":"Manic+Matching+%5Bv2.0.1%5D+for+Windows+%5BPuzzLe%5D%5BPC%5D%5BFuLL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0ef8026abc358592826e56bc25269316b9eed84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,239,128,38,171,195,88,89,40,38,229,107,194,82,105,49,107,158,237,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
