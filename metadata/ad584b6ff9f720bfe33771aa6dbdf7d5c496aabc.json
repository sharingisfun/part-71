The periodical, devoted to politics and culture, is self-described as &quot;the flagship of the left.&quot; Founded on July 6, 1865, it is published by The Nation Company, L.P., at 33 Irving Place, New York City. It is associated with The Nation Institute.\n\nThe Nation has bureaus in Washington, D.C., London, and South Africa, with departments covering architecture, art, corporations, defense, environment, films, legal affairs, music, peace and disarmament, poetry, and the United Nations. Circulation peaked at 187,000 in 2006 but by 2010 had dropped back to 145,000 in print, though digital subscriptions had risen to over 15,000.[5] Print ad pages declined by 5% from 2009 to 2010, while digital advertising rose 32.8% from 2009Ã¢â‚¬â€œ10.[6] Advertising accounts for 10% of total revenue for the magazine, while circulation totals 60%. The Nation has lost money in all but three or four years of operation and is sustained in part by a group of more than 30,000 donors called Nation Associates, who donate funds to the periodical above and beyond their annual subscription fees. This program accounts for 30% of the total revenue for the magazine. An annual cruise also generates $200,000 for the magazine. Since late 2012, the Nation Associates program has been called Nation Builders\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad584b6ff9f720bfe33771aa6dbdf7d5c496aabc","amp;dn":"The+Nation+-+2+June+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad584b6ff9f720bfe33771aa6dbdf7d5c496aabc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,88,75,111,249,247,32,191,227,55,113,170,109,189,247,213,196,150,170,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
