Page recorded the music at his personal studio The Sol. Robert Plant guests on one track, &quot;The Only One&quot;, while John Bonham's son Jason drums with Page for the first time on record.\n\nThis was originally intended to be a two album release. However, during the early recording stages of this album, Page's house was broken into and amongst the items stolen were the demo tapes which had been recorded up to that point.[1] Page didn't record any demos prior to recording the album itself\n\nJimmy Page Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars, synthesizer, vocals, production\nBarriemore Barlow Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion on &quot;Liquid Mercury&quot; and &quot;Emerald Eyes&quot;\nJason Bonham Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion\nChris Farlowe Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals on &quot;Hummingbird&quot;, &quot;Prison Blues&quot;, and &quot;Blues Anthem (If I Cannot Have Your Love...)&quot;\nTony Franklin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar on &quot;Wasting My Time&quot;\nFelix Krish Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar on &quot;The Only One&quot;, &quot;Liquid Mercury&quot;, &quot;Emerald Eyes&quot;, &quot;Prison Blues&quot;, and &quot;Blues Anthem (If I Cannot Have Your Love...)&quot;\nDurban Laverde Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar on &quot;Wanna Make Love&quot;, &quot;Writes of Winter&quot;, and &quot;Hummingbird&quot;\nJohn Miles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals &quot;Wasting My Time&quot; and &quot;Wanna Make Love&quot;\nRobert Plant Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals on &quot;The Only One&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e122514eff022ad52695c1e891cfc2b8864c14fd","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Page-+Outrider%281988%29+24bit-96khz+Vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e122514eff022ad52695c1e891cfc2b8864c14fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,34,81,78,255,2,42,213,38,149,193,232,145,207,194,184,134,76,20,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
