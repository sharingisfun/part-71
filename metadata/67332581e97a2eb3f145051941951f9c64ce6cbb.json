It reached #3 in the United Kingdom and #1 in the United States, becoming the first platinum-selling double album. In 2003 it was ranked number 203 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nIt was also released as two single long-players, Wheels of Fire (In the Studio) and Wheels of Fire (Live at the Fillmore), released together with similar cover art. In the UK the studio album art was black print on aluminium foil while the live album art was a negative image of the studio cover. In Japan the studio album art was black on gold foil while the live album art was black on aluminium foil. In Australia both covers were laminated copies of the Japanese releases (the double album was never released in Australia).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67332581e97a2eb3f145051941951f9c64ce6cbb","amp;dn":"Cream+-+Wheels+Of+Fire+2CD+%28Japan+Platinum+SHM-CD+%282013%29+FLAC+Be","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67332581e97a2eb3f145051941951f9c64ce6cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,51,37,129,233,122,46,179,241,69,5,25,65,149,31,156,100,206,108,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
