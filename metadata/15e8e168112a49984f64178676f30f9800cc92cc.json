Boys in The Cornfield\t\n\n\n\n\nIndie long before indie was cool, California-born, North Carolina-based Sally Spring stirs up a heady brew of folk (American and British), rock, Americana and country. A veteran performer who has worked up and down the East Coast and in Southern California, Spring is blessed with a beautiful voice that does both tough and tender very well. She's also a first-class songwriter as well as an accomplished interpreter of songs penned by others.\nOn Made of Stars, her fifth album, Spring augments her core band, which includes her husband, guitarist Ted Lyons, with Gurf Morlix, Susan Cowsill, Peter Holsapple, Caitlin Cary and others. The result is a powerful, ballad-driven collection that swings from the romance of Beautiful Ride to the melancholy of Summer's End. Spring's cover of Johnny Cash's I Still Miss Someone is as mournful as it comes, and she does the blues - and the times - proud with her rendition of Willie Dixon's It Don't Make Sense. In a homogenized world, Sally Spring is the organic real thing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15e8e168112a49984f64178676f30f9800cc92cc","amp;dn":"Sally+Spring+-+Made+of+Stars+%5B2010%5D+%5BLOG.cue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15e8e168112a49984f64178676f30f9800cc92cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,232,225,104,17,42,73,152,79,100,23,134,118,243,15,152,0,204,146,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
