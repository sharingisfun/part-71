The project comprises by less than a quarter titles available in current release, other prior versions and many items including the title, &quot;Porn Wars Deluxe,&quot; a 25-minute work, unique to this release.\n\nThe Lost Interview possibly? Although the price suggests a 2CD set. Music plus interview? &quot;The total interview runs about an hour and covers music politics and popular culture from 1950s through 1990. This interview was never released. It was recorded in 3 segments 1990 in LA, but never completed as a final project. Intended to be kind of retrospect of what happened to the personal growth and idealism of 60Ã¢â‚¬Â²s as it whitewashed into the self indulgence of the 70s and 80s and the corporatism of America.&quot;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisc 1\n01.
