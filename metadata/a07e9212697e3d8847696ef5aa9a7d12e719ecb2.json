I've posted the lyrics because the Mormon Tabernacle Choir is not known for their diction)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a07e9212697e3d8847696ef5aa9a7d12e719ecb2","amp;dn":"Finlandia%3A+Ormandy+Phil+Orch+MormonTabernacle+FLAC%2FEAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a07e9212697e3d8847696ef5aa9a7d12e719ecb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,126,146,18,105,126,61,136,71,105,110,245,170,154,125,18,231,25,236,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
