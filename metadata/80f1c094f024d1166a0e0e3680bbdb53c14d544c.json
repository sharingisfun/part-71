Yet this interest is overlooked by social and political theory at a time when we need to steer an adaptive course through the unnatural modern world of uneven population growth and decline, global mobility, and loss of family and communal ties. In modern Darwinian theory, bearing children is only one way to reproduce. Since we share genes with our families, ethnic groups, and the species as a whole, ethnocentrism and humanism can be adaptive. They can also be hazardous when taken to extremes. On Genetic Interests canvasses strategies and ethics for conserving our genetic interests in an environmentally sustainable manner sensitive to the interests of others.\n\n388 pages\nPublisher: Transaction Publishers (November 13, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1412805961\nISBN-13: 978-1412805964","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80f1c094f024d1166a0e0e3680bbdb53c14d544c","amp;dn":"On+Genetic+Interests+%282006%29+by+Frank+Kemp+Salter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80f1c094f024d1166a0e0e3680bbdb53c14d544c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,241,192,148,240,36,209,22,106,14,14,54,128,187,219,83,193,77,84,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
