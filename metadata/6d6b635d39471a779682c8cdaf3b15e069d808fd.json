We'll start by learning how Maya's Trax Editor can be used to retarget animation. We'll then take another approach and utilize MEL to accomplish the same thing. Finally, we'll work with Maya's intuitive Human IK toolset to retarget from a performance-captured animation to a custom skeleton. We'll also cover techniques for optimizing and correcting animation after it has been remapped. By the end of this set of tutorials, you will be familiar with several tools you have at your disposal for re-purposing animation, to, ultimately, save production time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d6b635d39471a779682c8cdaf3b15e069d808fd","amp;dn":"Animation+Retargeting+Techniques+in+Maya+-+DigitalTutors+720p+MP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d6b635d39471a779682c8cdaf3b15e069d808fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,107,99,93,57,71,26,119,150,130,200,205,175,59,21,224,105,216,8,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
