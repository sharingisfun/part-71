Work began in the summer of 1945 on the documentary, \nbut the film was left unfinished. FRONTLINE found it stored in a vault of London's Imperial War Museum and, in 1985, broadcast it for the first time using the title the Imperial War Museum gave it the title &quot;Memory of the Camps.&quot;\n\nAs the film's history shows, it was a project that was supervised by the British Ministry of Information and the American Office of War Information. \nAnd during that summer of 1945 some of the documentary editing was done under the direction of Alfred Hitchcock.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87e67ea800e1d389a4db4459d718ddc226586699","amp;dn":"FRONTLINE++Memory+of+the+Camps+1985","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87e67ea800e1d389a4db4459d718ddc226586699","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,230,126,168,0,225,211,137,164,219,68,89,215,24,221,194,38,88,102,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
