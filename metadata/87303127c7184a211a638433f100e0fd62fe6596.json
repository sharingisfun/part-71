One of the scant autobiographical facts she mentions is that her father, a Jewish physician, chose to raise his family in an Arab neighborhood in Algeria rather than a French one. As long as her father lived, the family was treated with respect, but when he died, she claims that the Arabs spurned the family because of their &quot; `jewfrenchness,' a double original sin.&quot; Cixous's essays reveal her vast erudition, covering topics as diverse as sexual difference, postcolonial theory, literary theory, love, life, and death. In one essay, her analysis of the works of James Joyce and Clarice Lispector are especially insightful. This is fascinating reading, especially for comparative literature and other scholars.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87303127c7184a211a638433f100e0fd62fe6596","amp;dn":"Helene+Cixous+-+Stigmata%3A+escaping+texts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87303127c7184a211a638433f100e0fd62fe6596","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,48,49,39,199,24,74,33,26,99,132,51,241,0,224,253,98,254,101,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
