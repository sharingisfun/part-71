They also know his former classmate-turned-famous bestselling novelist, Godfrey Priest.\n\nBut someone in Athena took Godfrey off the bestseller lists- permanently, and with extreme prejudice. Now, Charlie and Diesel must browse through the history section of the town's past to find a killer.\n\nClassified as Murder\nAging eccentric James Delacorte asks Charlie the librarian to do an inventory of his rare book collection-but the job goes from tedious to terrifying when James turns up dead. Relying on his cat Diesel to paw around for clues, Charlie has to catch the killer before another victim checks out.\n\nFile M for Murder\nAthena College's new writer in residence is native son and playwright Connor Lawton, known for his sharp writing-and sharper tongue. After an unpleasant encounter, librarian Charlie Harris heads home to a nice surprise: his daughter Laura is subbing for another Athena professor. Unfortunately her old flame Connor Lawton got her the job.\n\nBut before Connor finishes his newest play, he's murdered-and Laura is the prime suspect. Charlie and his faithful cat, Diesel, follow Connor's cluttered trail to find the true killer before his daughter is forever catalogued under M...for murderer.\n\nOut of Circulation\nEveryone in Athena, Mississippi, knows Charlie Harris, the librarian with a rescued Maine coon cat named Diesel. He's returned to his hometown to immerse himself in books, but when a feud erupts between the town's richest ladies, the writing on the wall spells murder.\n\nThe Ducote sisters are in a tiff with Vera Cassity over the location of this year's library fundraising gala, and Charlie would rather curl up in a corner than get into the fray. It seems everyone--even his housekeeper Azalea--has it in for Vera. And at the gala, she gives them good reason, with a public display of rancor aimed at anyone who gets in her way.\n\nBut those bitter words wind up being her last. When Charlie discovers Azalea standing over Vera's dead body, it's up to him--with a little help from Diesel--to clear Azalea's name, and catch a killer before his last chapter is finished.\n\nThe Silence of the Library\nEveryone in Athena, Mississippi, knows Charlie Harris, the librarian with a rescued Maine coon cat named Diesel. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s returned to his hometown to immerse himself in books, but a celebrated authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s visit draws an unruly swarm of fanatic mystery buffsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and one devious killer.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s National Library Week, and the Athena Public Library is planning an exhibit to honor the centenary of famous novelist Electra Barnes CartwrightÃ¢â‚¬â€creator of the beloved Veronica Thane series.\n\nCharlie has a soft spot for CartwrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s girl detective stories (not to mention an extensive collection of her books!). When the author agrees to make a rare public appearance, the news of her whereabouts goes viral overnight, and series devotees and book collectors converge on Athena.\n\nAfter all, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rumored that Cartwright penned Veronica Thane stories that remain under wraps, and one rabid fan will stop at nothingÃ¢â‚¬â€not even murderÃ¢â‚¬â€to get hold of the rare booksÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83fa143e2e3b684d49e590b74cc5915bbdca6094","amp;dn":"Cat+in+the+Stacks+Mystery+Series+-+Miranda+James","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83fa143e2e3b684d49e590b74cc5915bbdca6094","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,250,20,62,46,59,104,77,73,229,144,183,76,197,145,91,189,202,96,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
