It is mainly a Latin-flavored album, the first Montgomery recorded without a keyboardist.\n\nOn two of the songs included on Tequila, &quot;Tequila&quot; and &quot;The Thumb,&quot; Wes Montgomery had an opportunity to jam a bit while backed just by bassist Ron Carter, drummer Grady Tate and the congas of Ray Barretto. The other six selections utilize a string section arranged by Claus Ogerman but, even with a throwaway version of &quot;What the World Needs Now Is Love,&quot; there are memorable renditions of &quot;Bumpin' on Sunset&quot; and &quot;Insensatez&quot; that uplift this album quite a bit beyond the guitarist's later A&amp;M recordings.\n\nJazz writer Josef Woodard called the album &quot;an airy, melodious record, with the standout track being the gently brooding Montgomery original &quot;Bumpin' on Sunset,&quot; which features him playing double octaves-the same note played in three octaves.&quot;\n\nTrack listing\n\n1- &quot;Tequila&quot; (Chuck Rio)\n2- &quot;Little Child (Daddy Dear)&quot; (Wayne Shanklin)\n3- &quot;What the World Needs Now Is Love&quot; (Burt Bacharach, Hal David)\n4- &quot;The Big Hurt&quot; (Wayne Shanklin)\n5- &quot;Bumpin' on Sunset&quot; (Wes Montgomery)\n6- &quot;Insensatez (How Insensitive)&quot; (Vinicius De Moraes, Norman Gimbel, AntÃƒÂ´nio Carlos Jobim)\n7- &quot;The Thumb&quot; (Wes Montgomery)\n8- &quot;Midnight Mood&quot; (Raleigh, Josef Zawinul)\n\nPersonnel\n\nWes Montgomery Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\nRon Carter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\nGrady Tate Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\nRay Barretto Ã¢â‚¬â€œ conga\nGeorge Devens Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vibraphone\nBernard Eichen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ violin\nArnold Eidus Ã¢â‚¬â€œ violin\nPaul Gershman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ violin\nEmanuel Green Ã¢â‚¬â€œ violin\nJulius Held Ã¢â‚¬â€œ violin\nGene Orloff Ã¢â‚¬â€œ violin\nHarry Lookofsky Ã¢â‚¬â€œ violin\nJoseph Malin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ violin\nAbe Kessler Ã¢â‚¬â€œ cello\nCharles McCracken Ã¢â‚¬â€œ cello\nGeorge Ricci Ã¢â‚¬â€œ cello\nHarvey Shapiro Ã¢â‚¬â€œ cello\n\nProduction notes:\n\nCreed Taylor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ producer\nClaus Ogerman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ arranger, conductor\nRudy Van Gelder Ã¢â‚¬â€œ engineer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:703484f35009af70b06c306d7770273a65fd0284","amp;dn":"%7B24+96%7D+Wes+Montgomery+-+Tequila+1966+%7Bvinyl%7D+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"703484f35009af70b06c306d7770273a65fd0284","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,52,132,243,80,9,175,112,176,108,48,109,119,112,39,58,101,253,2,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
