The U.S. House of Representatives voted to hold former IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify about the agency's harassment of Tea Party groups. Maryland's Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings claimed that holding Lerner in contempt amounts to &quot;McCarthyism,&quot; despite the fact that 10% of donors to Tea Party groups were audited, a figure much higher than the audit rate for average Americans. \n\nAlex also covers new developments in political suppression and geopolitics. \n\nConstitutional lawyer and author Bruce Fein joins the show to discuss the FEC chairman's warning that government officials want to regulate the alternative media. \n\nAlso joining the broadcast is former United States Foreign Service employee &amp; author Peter Van Buren to break down the current standoff between world powers that is expanding beyond Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
