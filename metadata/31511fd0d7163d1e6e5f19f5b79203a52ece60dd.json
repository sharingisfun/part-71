With animation and clarity, The Beach Book tells sunbathers why beaches widen and narrow, and helps boaters and anglers understand why tidal inlets migrate. It gives home buyers insight into erosion rates and provides natural-resource managers and interested citizens with rich information on beach nourishment and coastal-zone development. And for all of us concerned about the long-term health of our beaches, it outlines the latest scientific information on sea-level rise and introduces ways to combat not only the erosion of beaches but also the decline of other coastal habitats.\n\nThe more we learn about coastline formation and maintenance, Carl Hobbs argues, the better we can appreciate and cultivate our shores. Informed by the latest research and infused with a passion for its subject, The Beach Book provides a wide-ranging introduction to the shore, and all of us who love the beach and its associated environments will find it timely and useful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31511fd0d7163d1e6e5f19f5b79203a52ece60dd","amp;dn":"The+Beach+Book+-+Science+of+the+Shore+-+Carl+Hobbs+-+Epub+-+Yeal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31511fd0d7163d1e6e5f19f5b79203a52ece60dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,81,31,208,215,22,61,30,110,95,25,245,183,146,3,165,46,206,96,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
