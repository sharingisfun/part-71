The Cream Remasters &quot;Live at Winterland&quot; set has a bonus track in the form of an alternative mix of &quot;We're Going Wrong,&quot; but that doesn't make this set 'incomplete'. This set has the full show, with the exception of &quot;I'm So Glad,&quot; which is cut both here and in the Cream Remasters set. - (RM) \n\nLineage:\n\nSilvers &gt; CD-R &gt; EAC v. 9.99 Prebeta 4 (Secure, Offset Correct) &gt; FLAC (8) &gt; You!\n\nArtwork, checksums, EAC logs, and info file included.\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3794ddd489b6a12a0821ee88f3e7b270713fdbaa","amp;dn":"Cream+-+Wheels+of+Ice+%28Tarantura%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3794ddd489b6a12a0821ee88f3e7b270713fdbaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,148,221,212,137,182,161,42,8,33,238,136,243,231,178,112,113,63,219,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
