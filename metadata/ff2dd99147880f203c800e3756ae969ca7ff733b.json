We have recorded our own custom choirs, orchestras, percussion and many other elements to create our unique sound. Plus, we've been fortunate to work with a small team of wonderfully creative people. We love this kind of music and hope that our passion comes through in our tracks.\n\nSince the launch in 2006, Epic Score's music has been licensed into many film trailers, game trailers, television themes, network promos, inside games and more. Plus, Epic Score's music is being distributed in more than 20 countries.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscography of Epic Score from ES001(2006) to ES027(2012)\n\nMP3 - 320kbps.\n\n\n\nIncludes a folder containing all album covers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff2dd99147880f203c800e3756ae969ca7ff733b","amp;dn":"Epic+Score","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff2dd99147880f203c800e3756ae969ca7ff733b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,45,217,145,71,136,15,32,60,128,14,55,86,174,150,156,167,255,115,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
