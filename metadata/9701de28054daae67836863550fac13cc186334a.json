Working continuously at the forefront of electronic music production, they incorporate in to their compositions the latest innovations of synthesis technologies while still referencing and celebrating their unique playful and emotive sound.\n\n'Hawkmoth', the first single from this album unfolds with undulating melodic patterns twisting in on themselves, while their trademark shimmering tones create a sheen of luminous harmonies, creating a track that evolves to epic proportions, a listening journey that Plaid know how to navigate so well. The rest of the album is equally stunning, with tracks like 'Hawkmoth' and 'Nafovanny' churning with slightly darker undertones, 'Wallet' glinting like a sunny vista and standout 'Martin Lunaire' brimming with effervescent spirit. Yet another masterful release from the duo.\n\nVinyl and CD pre-orders receive an instant MP3 download of &quot;Hawkmoth&quot; and &quot;Tether&quot;\nDigital pre-orders receive instant track downloads of &quot;Hawkmoth&quot; and &quot;Tether&quot;\nFull album delivered on release date of 19th May\n\nPlaid announce &quot;Reachy Prints&quot; due for release on May 19th on all formats.\n\n\n\n\nAll tracks are 128kbps mp3's. If you like this then buy the album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9701de28054daae67836863550fac13cc186334a","amp;dn":"Plaid_ReachyPrints_128_mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9701de28054daae67836863550fac13cc186334a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,1,222,40,5,77,170,230,120,54,134,53,80,250,193,60,193,134,51,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
