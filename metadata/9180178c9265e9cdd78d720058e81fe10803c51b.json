It was Elvis PresleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first TV appearance since 1960 and his first full-length special.  The show, produced and directed by Steve Binder, featured Elvis jamming with his band and solo, rocking in a ring surrounded by an audience, a gospel medley and a production number focused around the song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Guitar ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with Elvis as a traveling musician and what he encounters on his way.  Two Ã¢â‚¬Å“sit-downÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shows were taped with the band, two Ã¢â‚¬Å“stand-upÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shows (all in front of a small studio audience) plus the segments for the production numbers and a new song, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I Can DreamÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for the ending.  The show was shot in late June of 1968 at NBCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Burbank Studios and by the time the air date in December rolled around, it was clear some songs would need to be cut due to time restraints.  Many songs from the live shows were cut, as well as songs from the production numbers like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Let Yourself GoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (in a bordello scene which initially passed the NBC censors only to be vetoed by The Singer Sewing Company, the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sponsor) and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“It Hurts MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ karate fight.  The original 60 minute version (minus commercials) aired in December and again on August 17, 1969 (with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tiger ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ replacing Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blue ChristmasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).\n\nThe show was not seen again until November 20, 1977 on NBC, just two months after ElvisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death.  It was paired with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Aloha From HawaiiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, bridged by segments hosted by Ann-Margret and titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Memories Of ElvisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  This version of the special was expanded to include not only songs from the live shows like Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Be CruelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trying To get To YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ but the Ã¢â‚¬Å“It Hurts MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ karate scene.\n\nIn 1983 when the documentary film, Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Is ElvisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was issued on home video, the bordello segment was finally seen, and a year later the full special was issued on home video, in expanded form, like the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢77 edit, but this time including the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Let Yourself GoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bordello scene.  This is exactly what this version isÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ the full expanded Ã¢â‚¬â„¢68 Comeback Special in all its glory, but edited from digital sources, for best possible quality!\n\nThe first version available worldwide on DVD in 2004 was part of a box set called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Elvis Ã¢â‚¬â„¢68 Comeback Special Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Deluxe EditionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  Although this set included  all four live shows in their entirety and all the production scene elements in their raw forms, the special itself was presented in an Ã¢â‚¬Å“adaptedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ version.  In other words, the original December Ã¢â‚¬â„¢68 edit, except including the bordello scene, before Singer asked it be cut out.\n\nFinally in 2006 came Ã¢â‚¬Å“Elvis: Ã¢â‚¬â„¢68 Comeback Special EditionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  Fans looked forward to a digital version of the old VHS version (the definitive version) were subjected to a Ã¢â‚¬Å“re-edited and expandedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ version instead.  The first change of note was the use of different takes of some of the songs not included on the original special.  Was Sony-BMG forgetting we already HAD all the takes from the previous box?  Then was the modern wipe-style editing which tried to give the show a modern look.  Worst of all though, was Ã¢â‚¬Å“One NightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (clearly a highlight of the special) joined already in progress half-way through the song!!  It took one of the peak moments of the special and cut it in half, ruining the moment for a whole new generation who probably will never see the show in its entirety.\n\nThis DVD isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trying to re-write history.  It simply exists due to one fanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distaste of the versions out there.  Most Elvis fans cherish their old VHS versions and it is baffling why Sony-BMG felt they needed to change the special so drastically.  The raw elements of the show are great, but if you want to enjoy the expanded TV special, the way it was meant to be seen, this is the DVD for you!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9180178c9265e9cdd78d720058e81fe10803c51b","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+The+Definitive+NBC+Special+%281968%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9180178c9265e9cdd78d720058e81fe10803c51b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,128,23,140,146,101,233,205,215,141,114,0,88,232,31,225,8,3,197,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
