A young coal miner volunteers to be evolved.\n\nThe young man is gradually evolved into the man of the far future. He develops a thirst for knowledge, E.S.P. powers, and the desire to destroy the local village.\n\nThe future man wants to be further evolved into a being of pure thought. In the evolution chamber, his girlfriend reverses the process, turning him back into his normal self.\n\nOne of my favorite Outer Limits episodes. Hope you like it as well. If you know of one you might like to see I can probably come up with it. Just let me know.\n\n\nThis one is with David McCallum even before his Illya Kuryakin roll on The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement) Still remember that.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfea35c8f600f26c2a8baf0cfb05cc574837a56d","amp;dn":"The+Outer+Limits+-+The+Sixth+Finger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfea35c8f600f26c2a8baf0cfb05cc574837a56d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,234,53,200,246,0,242,108,42,139,175,12,251,5,204,87,72,55,165,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
