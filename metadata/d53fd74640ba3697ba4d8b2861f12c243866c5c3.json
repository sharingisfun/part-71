The Northern Messenger was (at this point in its history) a non-denominational Christian children's story paper, published weekly. Despite the Christian aspect of the story paper, it has some good stories and interesting advertising, editorials and news articles from a time when Canada had just entered WWII.\n\nThis torrent contains 58 weekly issues of this story paper from 1940 (47 issues) and 1941 (11 issues) scanned in hi-res colour.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d53fd74640ba3697ba4d8b2861f12c243866c5c3","amp;dn":"Northern+Messenger+-+Story+Paper+1940-1941","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d53fd74640ba3697ba4d8b2861f12c243866c5c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,63,215,70,64,186,54,151,186,77,139,40,97,241,44,36,56,102,197,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
