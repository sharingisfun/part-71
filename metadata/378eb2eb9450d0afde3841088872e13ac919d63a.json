During his speech, Obama announced plans to enact his socialist agenda through executive orders, which 67% of Americans are completely opposed to according to a CNN poll. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tx.) also pointed out that Obama's imperial presidency threatens the liberty of every citizen. \n\nGerald Celente, publisher of The Trends Journal, joins the show to break down Obama's multitude of lies from last night and the current, worldwide concerns over bank runs. \n\nVeteran Bilderberg investigator and author Daniel Estulin also joins today's transmission to discuss the dangers of transhumanism and the elite's drive for total control.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
