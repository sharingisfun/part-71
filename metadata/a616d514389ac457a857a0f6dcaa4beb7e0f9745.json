The debut was particularly successful both commercially and artistically, a very entertaining and professional effort, somewhere stuck between ZEPPELIN, TULL and BEATLES. The second album was more folky but saw two members leave after its release, leaving Nicklin alone at the helm and recording the third album, sometimes bordering country music. \n\n\n  Tracklist\n\n\n\tBanjocul \t                       0:45\n\tMountain Music Part 1 \t               6:22\n\tHey You People \t                       1:25\n\tTeaparty For An Orchard \t       6:10\n\tOde To Resistance \t               5:55\n\tYour Song And Mine \t               5:31\n\tGideon's Trap \t                       5:40\n\tBlue Day's Morning \t               2:08\n\tMountain Music Part 2 \t               7:23","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a616d514389ac457a857a0f6dcaa4beb7e0f9745","amp;dn":"CULPEPER%27S+ORCHARD-Culpeper%27s+Orchard%5Bmp3%5D%5Bprog1971%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a616d514389ac457a857a0f6dcaa4beb7e0f9745","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,22,213,20,56,154,196,87,168,87,160,246,220,170,75,235,126,15,151,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
