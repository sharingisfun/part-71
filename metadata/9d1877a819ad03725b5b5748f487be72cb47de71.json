Those Ã¢â‚¬Ëœin the know,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ or closely connected to the acoustic music world, recognized the fiery flatpicker as the first guitar gunslinger with Ricky Skaggs &amp; Kentucky Thunder in the late Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s, a prestigious studio musician, or the fourth member of Hot Rize for their recurring reunions.\n\nSince leaving Skaggs, Bryan had contented himself with studio work and free lance touring, which kept him busy, but over the past few years the notion of doing more with his music began to percolate up in his mind. As such thoughts became serious, he knew what it would take Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he would have to start singing as well as playing guitar.\n\nOn his latest Sugar Hill project, Into My Own, Sutton launches his career as a vocalist. Five of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 12 tracks feature him as lead singer, something Bryan says heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been doing off and on since he was a child.&quot;\n\nBluegrasstoday.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d1877a819ad03725b5b5748f487be72cb47de71","amp;dn":"Bryan+Sutton+-+Into+My+Own+%282014%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d1877a819ad03725b5b5748f487be72cb47de71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,24,119,168,25,173,3,114,91,91,87,72,244,135,190,114,203,71,222,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
