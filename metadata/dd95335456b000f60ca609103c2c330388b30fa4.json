Hope you like them!\n\nGame Name: Wii Calvin Tucker's Redneck Jamboree\nGame ID  : [RVNP7J]\nLanguage : ENGLISH (maybe others, not checked)\nType     : Mini Games (American Life?)\n\n** IMPORTANT **\nPlease seed to at least 200%/2.0 each, not just leech and run, so that others get a chance to download it quickly too. I'm doing this to help. Please help too.\n\nAs ever, if you like it, maybe buy a Wii game to keep the franchise going as a thank-you for this freebie! Even better, get one not listed on here, and upload for me :-)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost of my 700+ of my Wii games are listed here (text file format directory listing):  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://txt.do/rbsm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://txt.do/rbsm&lt;/a&gt; \n\nFeel free to search and see if there is a missing one you want me to upload - add a request in the comments and i'll try to help out.\n\nPlease Google the title or game ID if you want to know about this or any of the other games, as I can't remember half of them myself to answer any questions. Also check YouTube for a review/demo of games, as some are pretty crap (like Ninjabread Man and the Billy the Wizard - that was so crap I deleted it straight away, so not got that anyway!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd95335456b000f60ca609103c2c330388b30fa4","amp;dn":"Wii+Calvin+Tucker%27s+Redneck+Jamboree+%5BRVNP7J%5D+%5BWBFS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd95335456b000f60ca609103c2c330388b30fa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,149,51,84,86,176,0,246,12,166,9,16,60,44,51,3,136,179,15,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
