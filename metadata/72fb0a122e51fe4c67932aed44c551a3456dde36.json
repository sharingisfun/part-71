In 1990, Dunn helped his own mother (who was adopted as a baby) locate her biological family, and that single event inspired him and his then-business partner to build an organization that did one thing: help people reunite with long-lost friends and family members. ``APB With Troy Dunn'' documents the work he does, which was previously filmed for WE TV's five-season run of ``The Locator.'' A more modern twist in ``APB,'' however, allows TNT viewers to use a social media app to contribute to Dunn's mission of bringing families and loved ones back together.\n\n\nFirst Aired: \tJanuary 24, 2014\nAir Day: \tFriday\nAir Time: \t9:00 PM\nRuntime: \t43 minutes\nNetwork: \tTNT\nGenre: \t        Reality\n\n\n\nEpisode Synopsis: Troy helps a woman connect with a young couple who pulled her from a fiery car crash.
