While they published a number of Canadian creations, they are perhaps best known for printing Canadian reworkings of scripts bought from American publisher Fawcett Comics.\n\n American comic books were barred from crossing the border into Canada when the War Exchange Conservation Act passed in December 1940. In order to fill in the void and supply Canadian kids' appetite for comic books, Anglo American and Maple Leaf Publishing started publishing comics in March 1941.\n\n Amongst Anglo-American's characters were Freelance, Commander Steel, Purple Rider, Red Rover, Kip Keene, Terry Kane and Dr Destine.\n\n\nGrand Slam Comics: 52, 54, v_03\nGrand Slam Three Aces Comics: 44, 46-50\nRobin Hood And Company Comics - 31-34\nSpy Smasher Comics - V1_01\nThree Aces Comics - v04_02-03, v05_51, 53-54\n\n\nBell Features - 1939-1953\n\nCompany known as Commercial Signs of Canada from 1939-1942, though their first comics weren't published until 1941.
