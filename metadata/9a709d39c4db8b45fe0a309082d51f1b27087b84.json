All of Cat Stevens' hits, and his most popular album tracks, are here, and the four discs span his entire career, from the mid-'60s to the end of the 1970s (with just one cut, the late-'90s finale &quot;God Is the Light,&quot; postdating his change of name to Yusuf Islam). The usual ribbons on the wrapping are also properly tied, with a few previously unissued demos/outtakes/live performances, some non-LP singles and B-sides, and a couple live 1974 recordings from Saturnight (Live in Tokyo) that have never been available on CD before. The only surprise, in fact -- at least, to the many listeners who are likely unaware of Yusuf Islam's increasing willingness to acknowledge his Cat Stevens past in the 21st century -- is the active participation of Islam in the set, to the point of contributing the principal essay in the liner notes (as well as adding some printed comments for many of the tracks). Refreshingly, the box also does not shun his false start as a British pop star in 1966 and 1967, with almost the entirety of the first disc devoted to pre-1970 recordings. While overly orchestrated and not much like the folky singer/songwriter music for which Stevens became most famous, those early sides are valuable both for documenting his first impact on the pop world and for containing some material that's worthwhile in and of itself.  The hardcore fan will naturally be most interested in the rarities, and while none of these are on par with Stevens' finest work, they both carry historical interest and fit in well with the lengthy program. There's a 1965 folk-rock-poppish demo, &quot;Back to the Good Old Times&quot;; a sparse, haunting acoustic 1968 demo, &quot;If Only Mother Could See Me Now&quot;; a January 1970 demo, &quot;Honey Man,&quot; with Elton John on piano; another January 1970 demo, &quot;Time/Fill My Eyes,&quot; that would have not been out of place on his Mona Bone Jakon album; &quot;Don't Be Shy&quot; and &quot;If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out,&quot; both of which were used in the Harold and Maude soundtrack; the quirky, instrumental 1972 B-side &quot;Crab Dance&quot;; and the live November 1979 version of &quot;Father and Son&quot; (for the Year of the Child concert in London) that marked his final concert appearance. To be unkind, there's another way this anthology is entirely typical of major box sets: the final disc is much inferior to what precedes it, Stevens' material becoming considerably blander as he approached the end of the '70s. But it's certainly likely to stand as the best thorough retrospective of his career, with a superb 98-page booklet that, in addition to Islam's essay and comments, also includes quotes from Stevens' producers and side musicians, as well as a detailed time line of his career.\nAll Music Review by Richie Unterberger.\n\n \n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Back To The Good Old Times\n[02] I Love My Dog\n[03] Portobello Road\n[04] Here Comes My Baby\n[05] Matthew &amp; Son\n[06] The Tramp\n[07] I'm Gonna Get Me A Gun\n[08] School Is Out\n[09] A Bad Night\n[10] The Laughing Apple\n[11] Kitty\n[12] Blackness Of Night\n[13] The First Cut Is The Deepest\n[14] Northern Wind\n[15] Moonstone\n[16] Come On Baby (Shift That Log)\n[17] Lovely City (When Do You Laugh)\n[18] Here Comes My Wife\n[19] The View From The Top\n[20] Where Are You\n[21] If Only Mother Could See Me Now\n[22] Honey Man - - - Cat Stevens &amp; Elton John\n[23] The Joke\n\nCD01 Play Time - 01h:05m:23s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Time - Fill My Eyes\n[02] Lady D'Arbanville\n[03] Trouble\n[04] Pop Star\n[05] Katmandu\n[06] Lilywhite\n[07] I've Got a Thing About Seeing My Grandson Grow Old\n[08] Where Do the Children Play\n[09] Wild World\n[10] Sad Lisa\n[11] On the Road to Find Out\n[12] Father and Son\n[13] Love Lives in the Sky\n[14] Don't Be Shy\n[15] If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\n[16] The Day They Make Me Tsar\n[17] The Wind\n[18] Moonshadow\n[19] Morning Has Broken\n[20] How Can I Tell You\n[21] Peace Train\n[22] I Want To Live in a Wigwam\n\nCD02 Play Time - 01h:16m:00s\n\nCD03 Track Listings\n\n[01] Crab Dance\n[02] Sitting\n[03] Silent Sunlight\n[04] Angelsea\n[05] Can't Keep It In\n[06] 18th Avenue (Kansas City Nightmare)\n[07] The Hurt\n[08] Foreigner Suite\n[09] Oh Very Young\n[10] Music\n[11] Sun - C79\n[12] King Of Trees\n[13] Bad Penny (Live)\n[14] Lady D'Arbanville [Live]\n[15] Another Saturday Night\n\nCD03 Play Time - 01h:10m:18s\n\nCD04 - The Last - Track Listings\n\n[01] Whistlestar\n[02] Novim's Nightmare\n[03] Majik Of Majiks\n[04] Banapple Gas\n[05] Blue Monday\n[06] Doves\n[07] Hard Headed Woman [Live]\n[08] Tuesday's Dead [Live]\n[09] Ruins [Live]\n[10] (Remember The Days Of The) Old Schoolyard\n[11] Life\n[12] (I Never Wanted) To Be A Star\n[13] Child For A Day\n[14] Just Another Night\n[15] Daytime\n[16] Last Love Song\n[17] Never\n[18] Father And Son [Live]\n[19] God Is The Light - - - Raihan And Yusuf Islam\n\nCD04 Play Time - 01h:09m:00s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 04h:40m:44s\nTotal File Size....................... 1.73mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
