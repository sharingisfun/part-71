His coverage of the &quot;bandit&quot; raids in 1915 and the U.S. military buildup along the border in 1916 is of great historical importance, as are his photos of the revolution in northeastern Mexico in 1913-1914.Samponaro and Vanderwood, using the Runyon collection of nearly 13,000 negatives and prints, shed new light on the history of the U.S. and Mexico. War Scare is a must for anyone interested in U.S. or borderlands history, or the history of photography. Number one in the Barker Texas History Center Series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6494a0a6071271c5ba6e61ccf84c6a5ef58541d6","amp;dn":"War+Scare+on+the+Rio+Grande+-+Robert+Runyons+photographs+of+the+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6494a0a6071271c5ba6e61ccf84c6a5ef58541d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,148,160,166,7,18,113,197,186,110,97,204,248,76,106,94,245,133,65,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
