He's been \na Muscle Shoals picker and has played with loads of greats. He was also \nthe lead guitarist spicing up the &quot;Black &amp; Blue&quot; album by the Stones.\nCrimson Tide was a band Wayne had with his brother Dale. They released \ntwo albums, Crimson Tide being the first. Once you get past the slickness, you'll find a really great album, full of splendid picking and singing. It's a \nlittle bit of everything on this album, but that's the way I like it best. \nThere's soul, there's rock, some funk and all Southern flavored.\n\n&quot;Reckless Love&quot; is the second and final album by Wayne Perkins' Crimson Tide. \nA band formed with his brother Dale after having played a lot as session \nguitarist. It's another good album, which may sound too slick for some, but \nit more than makes up by some excellent playing. The music ranges from Funk \nRock to AOR to Southern Rock. Some marvelous songs too. \nI hope so. So, sit you down and listen to the guitar antics of Wayne Perkins.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a143e0c68d66b78620f90ac6600fa55ba235543","amp;dn":"Crimson+Tide+1978+Crimson+Tide+-+Reckess+Love+1979","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a143e0c68d66b78620f90ac6600fa55ba235543","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,20,62,12,104,214,107,120,98,15,144,172,102,0,250,85,186,35,85,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
