It's an interesting game to say the least. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n-Sershadak\n\n\n\nDynasty Tactics is a strategy game for the Sony PlayStation 2. The title is set \n\nduring the Three Kingdoms era and takes place after the Yellow Turban Rebellion and \n\nDong Zhuo's death. The gameplay uses elements from Koei's in depth turn based system \n\nin the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. While the Dynasty Warriors series is a \n\ncontemporary interpretation of the setting, the mood in Dynasty Tactics is archaic \n\nand gritty, closer to the tone set in the novel. The players can choose to roughly \n\nfollow events from the epic or dramatically diverge from it.\n\n\n^Straight from wikipedia :P","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3d2a40ccb6624f9ab5723a9e78bb76a067d58e5","amp;dn":"Dynasty+Tactics+%5BNTSC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3d2a40ccb6624f9ab5723a9e78bb76a067d58e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,210,164,12,203,102,36,249,171,87,35,169,231,139,183,106,6,125,88,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
