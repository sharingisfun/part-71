Adam Bell (Gyllenhaal) is a glum, disheveled history professor, who seems disinterested even in his beautiful girlfriend, Mary (Laurent). Watching a movie on the recommendation of a colleague, Adam spots his double, a bit-part actor named Anthony Clair, and decides to track him down. The identical men meet and their lives become bizarrely and irrevocably intertwined. Gyllenhaal is transfixing as both Adam and Anthony, provoking empathy as well as disapproval while embodying two distinct personas. With masterfully controlled attention to detail, Villeneuve takes us on an enigmatic and gripping journey through a world that is both familiar and strange - and hard to shake off long after its final, unnerving image. ENEMY, adapted from Nobel Prize-winning author JosÃƒÂ© Saramago's 2004 novel The Double, is about the power of the subconscious. In the end, only one man can survive... http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/enemy_2013/\n\nSource-------- US BD / AVC @21MBps\nReleased------ 2014/06/16\nFormat-------- Matroska/h264\nFile size----- 5.5 GB\nLength-------- 1:30:52\nVideo Bit rate ~7.1 MBps\nResolution---- 1920/800 ( 2.40:1)\nFrame rate---- 23.976 fps\nAudio--------- ENG DTS 5.1 @1.5 MBps\nSubtitles----- Eng &amp; sdh, Fre, Ita, Spa\nEncoder------- HighCode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:009b7f2bcbfb4f312bdf8ea6743e564ea746229f","amp;dn":"Enemy+2013+BDRip+1080p+x264+DTS+5.1-HighCode","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"009b7f2bcbfb4f312bdf8ea6743e564ea746229f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,155,127,43,203,251,79,49,43,223,142,166,116,62,86,78,167,70,34,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
