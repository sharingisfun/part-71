Art historians consider Twachtman's style of impressionism to be among the more personal and experimental of his generation. He was a member of &quot;The Ten&quot;, a loosely-allied group of American artists dissatisfied with professional art organizations, who banded together in 1898 to exhibit their works as a stylistically-unified group.\nHis landscapes from this time exhibit the loosely-brushed, shadowy technique taught at Munich. Twachtman also learned etching, and sometimes carried etching plates with him that he could use to spontaneously record a scene.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f51e4f518eb683c54c6689e2af5d9bf84df92512","amp;dn":"John+Henry+Twachtman+Paintings+1853-1902+Art","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f51e4f518eb683c54c6689e2af5d9bf84df92512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,30,79,81,142,182,131,197,76,102,137,226,175,93,155,248,77,249,37,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
