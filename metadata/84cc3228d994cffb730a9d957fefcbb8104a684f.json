Every summer since, New York CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been taken by storm with out-of-the-box flavors like Raspberries &amp; Basil, Peach &amp; Bourbon, and Cantaloupe &amp; Tarragon from PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pops. Now, the People behind the phenomenon share their DIY ethos in a breezy cookbook that teaches how to pair ingredients, balance sweetness, and explore fruits (and vegetables and herbs!)--in simple recipes that work with standard ice pop molds or improvised ones. With a chapter devoted to shave ice plus recipes for grownup boozy pops sprinkled throughout, PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pops proves itself top of the pops.\n\nAbout the Author\nJoel Horowitz, Nathalie Jordi, and David Carrell founded PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pops in 2008.
