Empty Cup\n\n\n\n\nGurf Morlix sings in a tone somehow both affectless and mournful, as if a shadow of death had already crept in and half-zombified his emotions. Part of the pleasure in his new album, his first of original songs in three years, derives from the contrast between scenery and focus: the suffusive sadness of the melodies, the stark and rootsy Americana sounds, and the mordant lyrics, set against the insistent hint of a residual innocence in MorlixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s broad, flat vocal delivery.\n\nWhat he describes as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the muddyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the fecund reading room of a library of roots-music idioms Ã¢â‚¬â€œ encompasses flavors not just of folk, country, and blues, but even jazz in the occasional non-rootsy chord change or melodic scale, like the diminished chord in Ã¢â‚¬Å“GasolineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or the unexpected shift to a minor mode in the chorus of the powerful opening track, a prison lament called Ã¢â‚¬Å“My LifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Been Taken.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Latin flavor to the sly Ã¢â‚¬Å“LookinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ For YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: Ã¢â‚¬Å“You know I like it dark and hot/Torn and twisted, tied in a knot/YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got the slant, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got the skew/You know how I want it, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing I can do.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In that passage, especially the last rhyme, Morlix shows how handy he is with giving the rougher Anglo-Saxon side of English vocabulary a spirit thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s somehow both raw and sophisticated.\n\nMinor keys, anxious B3 organ drones, and clotted drumbeats dress stripped-down arrangements rooted in MorlixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expert guitar work. In the unrelentingly gloomy title track he mixes flower-child verbiage with a play on words, all over a heavy beat. He infuses even the pretty folk melody Ã¢â‚¬Å“Small WindowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with tension, reflecting the literal prison of Ã¢â‚¬Å“My LifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Been TakenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in imagery of loneliness: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some things I shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have done/Some battles I should have wonÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a small window IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m looking through/It ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t much of a viewÃ¢â‚¬Â¦If I could get that thing open/I just might squeeze through.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The song with the happiest musical flavor, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bang Bang Bang,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an indictment of American gun culture. Only Ã¢â‚¬Å“These Are My BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ overstays its welcome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a8ba3864d71c75c66c111a15763e75170e3a5de","amp;dn":"Gurf+Morlix+-+Finds+The+Present+Tense+%5B2013%5D+%5BEAC.Log%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a8ba3864d71c75c66c111a15763e75170e3a5de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,139,163,134,77,113,199,92,102,193,17,161,87,99,231,81,112,227,165,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
