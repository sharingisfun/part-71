The first 30 minutes was a rebroadcast of the first half-hour from the January 1st show. After the half-hour break, Alex was on live and said that they had done that on purpose because he was &quot;just too angry and upset&quot; to go on air, &quot;by a combination of things.&quot;\n\nThe Alex Jones Show \nThursday, 09 January 2014\n\n\n[sebaygo1]\n\n\nShow Description\n................\n\nFrom the Infowars web site :: Alex continues coverage of the danger of radiation from the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant reaching California. The Infowars team reports on abnormal radiological readings discovered at Half Moon Bay in San Mateo County, California. The team also files a report from the Humboldt Bay Power Plant in Eureka, California, a nuclear plant that will be decommissioned in 2015. \n\nAlex also talks about a report confirming that the Pentagon is stockpiling potassium iodide in response to Fukushima and other stories, including the controversy over a video featuring a toddler spouting racist epithets.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
