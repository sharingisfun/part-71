A viewer asked if there were exercises that would improve their performance in the sack, and the answer is an exhilarating YES!\nGreat sex involves movement, lots of movement, including flips, twists, and a flying trapeze in my opinion.  Regardless of what you are doing, if you are moving, it is because of muscle contractions and this is certainly true during sex.  Muscles that are active during sex not only need strength, but also endurance unless you are unfortunate enough to have a 2-minute man.  While the muscles of the pelvic floor, often trained with Kegel exercises, can enhance sex for both men and women, these muscles do not contribute to movement during sex.  The primary muscles a woman should focus on for sexual performance are those within the lumbo-hip-pelvic complex, which are the muscles surrounding the pelvis.\nThe muscles responsible for movement during sex, or the Ã¢â‚¬Å“prime moversÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, are different depending on the position you are in.  If you are in the missionary position, different muscles will be engaged than if you are in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“doggie-styleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ position.  While I could write chapters on this topic and the hundreds of different positions, I will focus on the missionary and the many various girl-on-top positions.  These positions require a woman to have strength and control of the muscle responsible for pelvic tilting to align the vagina and also for pelvic rocking or the Ã¢â‚¬Å“humping motionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:829600d58935dd004c79070c81eaca76bc001044","amp;dn":"Sexual+Performance%5BDT123%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"829600d58935dd004c79070c81eaca76bc001044","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,150,0,213,137,53,221,0,76,121,7,12,129,234,202,118,188,0,16,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
