But with the traveling I've been doing these past few weeks, and with the traveling I still hope to do this summer and in the very near future, I've just been pressed for time to further the idea along.  But a big thank you once again to Nathan.S, and everyone else for their help on the project.\n\n(2) Please keep the 2014 requests flowing.  Because I'm not by my computer as much, I am sure I am missing lots of new releases.  And although you can be sure I will eventually share anything I have from 2014, sometimes when an album request is made, it is the first time I am learning of that album.  So I am able to spend some time specifically hunting it down.  Otherwise it might become overlooked entirely.\n\n(3) The best way to communicate with me is always in my most current thread.  Occasionally I will revisit older threads, and notice some of you asking me questions.  I want to help you out, and answer those questions if I am able to, but with the volume of torrents I have here on The Pirate Bay, it's just a whole lot easier, and less time consuming for me to monitor my most current thread for that correspondence.\n\n(4) And last but not least, do with these albums what you feel in your heart is right.  But I still encourage you to seed what you've downloaded, share with your friends and family, support the bands you intend of keeping, praise God almighty for the inspiration, talents, and opportunities He has given these musicians to make this music available to us today, and never substitute time spent in your Bible for the entertainment value found within these songs.\n\nROCK: 390 East, Andrew Ehrenzeller, The Museum, The Remission Flow, Stellar Kart.
