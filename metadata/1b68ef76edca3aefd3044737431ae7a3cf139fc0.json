Gross.pdf\n\nForrest and Gross expose the scientific failure, the religious essence, and the political ambitions of &quot;intelligent design&quot; creationism. They examine the movement's &quot;Wedge Strategy,&quot; which has advanced and is succeeding through public relations rather than through scientific research.
