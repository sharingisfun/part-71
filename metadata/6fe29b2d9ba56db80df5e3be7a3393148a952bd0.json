There are limitations that make using very dense, highly detailed models impractical. They can be difficult to maneuver around a scene and the topology may not be ideal for deformation.\n\nFor this reason, we can transfer high resolution detail and color information from a high resolution model to a low resolution target and Maya LT provides tools for doing just that.\n\nIn this tutorial we'll take a brief look at texture baking in Maya LT. We'll look at the Turtle Texture Baking interface and some of the basic settings to look for. We'll then transfer a color texture from one model to another. We'll also look at transferring detail via normal maps, baking ambient occlusion maps, and learn to bake lighting into a texture.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.digitaltutors.com/tutorial/1589-Map-Baking-Techniques-in-Maya-LT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.digitaltutors.com/tutorial/1589-Map-Baking-Techniques-in-Maya-LT&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fe29b2d9ba56db80df5e3be7a3393148a952bd0","amp;dn":"Map+Baking+Techniques+in+Maya+LT+DigitalTutors+720p+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fe29b2d9ba56db80df5e3be7a3393148a952bd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,226,155,45,155,165,109,184,13,245,227,190,122,51,147,20,138,149,43,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
