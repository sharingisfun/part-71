For one Celeste Bonin (FKA Kaitlyn in the WWE) that dream became reality when she was excepted and welcomed by the WWE after a try out in FCW where she stood out and was instantly invited to be apart of the WWE developmental system down in Florida.\n\nHer story really is unique because after a very short amount of time she was called up to take part of Season 3 of NXT after really having a limited amount of training. Her first match ever was in front of a live crowd. Her training for the most part was in front of a global audience and to much of the surprise of everyone she won the season as she was also paired with the very outspoken Vicki Guerrero. Kaitlyn had a very athletic background in which she talks about during this interview which might have helped her excel into the spotlight with her bodybuilding career where she won several prestigious competitions. We talk all about her background in body building and fitness.\n\nOnce on WWE TV Kaitlyn was still training in FCW with a lot of the other future stars of the Diva division and formed a close bond with current WWE Diva Champion AJ. You will hear all about their friendship which started in FCW and lasted to her very last match of her WWE career in Philadelphia where she asked for her release. We talk in great detail about their matches together, forming a tag team and eventually their split where AJ beat her for the belt and of course their historic contract signing which led to that match.\n\nAlong the way KaitlynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career was amazing as she got to work with every girl in the division and eventually became the face of the WWE womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s division by capturing the WWE Diva Champion in her hometown of Houston TX by defeating one of her favorite women to work with Eve Torres.\n\nYou will hear all about training and coming up with the other girls in the company like Aksana, Maxine, Naomi, AJ and countless others. We cover her entire stay in FCW up until she got her big break on NXT and than getting to work Smackdown. You will hear all about her pairing with Dolph Ziggler and what it was like to go to TV for the first time. What happened backstage in the locker room early on and where did the new girls have to change. How were they treated by the rest of the locker room and did politics ever come into play.\n\nYou will hear all about her interactions with the front office wether it was with her number one supporter HHH or even Vince McMahon himself. We discuss her program with Vickie Guerrero which really helped put her on the map. You will hear all about her matches with LayCool and how much pressure was there to work with Undertakers wife. How did the veteran girls treat her like the Bella Twins, Natalya, Kelly Kelly, and Beth Phoenix? She talks in great detail on what it was like to step in the ring with almost every name in the Diva division. Kaitlyn holds nothing back and her stories are in great detail as she paints a great picture of her experiences.\n\nYou will hear all about the formation of her tag team with AJ the Chickbusters and how that got started. She got to work with some of the top acts like Daniel Bryan, Dolph Ziggler, Big E, AJ and countless others. Kaitlyn talks about being on the road full time for the WWE and who she traveled with. You will hear how she was able to eventually break thru and become one of the WWEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top girls as she worked with AJ after their split which eventually lead her to face Eve Torres and capture the Diva title.\n\nWe talk about her angles with Aksana as she was the mysterious attacker and everything in between, trust me RFVIDEO asks her everything you would want to know about her entire WWE career. Kaitlyn is also very open and honest about her health scare which at one point which she had to talk to the office about. You will hear how supportive they were with her in getting her the help she needed to get back on track.\n\nWas she upset that she was not part of Total Divas reality TV show and what lead her to leave the company and ask for her release in Baltimore MD the night before her final match in Philadelphia with AJ.
