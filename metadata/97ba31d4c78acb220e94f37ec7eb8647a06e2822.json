The series was on a brief hiatus with issue 32 in 1949, in the time-period that superhero comics had lost it's popularity, but resumed in 1954 with issue 33 as plain ' Sub-Mariner'.\n\nContinued Sub-Mariner Volume 1 \n \nSub-Mariner is the continuation of Sub-Mariner Comics, witch had been on hiatus since 1949. This volume picked up the numbering with issue 33 in 1954.  \nAlthough It's revival was short-lived, the series lasted longer then the also revived Captain America Comics series and Young Men series. This was most likely because publisher Martin Goodman had developed plans with a TV network-company to have Sub-mariner appear in his own live-action tv show. Plans for the show however never materialized and thus the series was cancelled as well. \n\nThis volume is complete - using scanned issues even with the inclusion of some digital issues in a seperate folder. I think for a series this old the inclusion of the scanned issues with all the wear and tear of time is important","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97ba31d4c78acb220e94f37ec7eb8647a06e2822","amp;dn":"Sub-Mariner+Comics+%28001+-+042%29+%281941+-+1945+%26amp%3B+1954+-+1955%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97ba31d4c78acb220e94f37ec7eb8647a06e2822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,186,49,212,199,138,203,34,14,148,243,126,199,235,134,71,160,110,40,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
