This documentary goes behind the scenes at Prestige and discovers that, when it comes to upmarket pawn, everyone has a story to tell. Headed up by slick former property developer James Constantinou, and with a quirky team of asset experts including salt-of-the-earth jewellery expert Lawrence and feisty PA Jo, Prestige is the go-to place for people who want fast cash in well-heeled Surrey, pawning everything from million-pound helicopters to Lambourghinis and Ã‚Â£25,000 Hermes handbags. And it's an empire on the move: James is taking big risks investing in a new store in Richmond and has bigger plans too. But will expanding make or break the business?\n\n2)  Part 2 \nThe staff at Prestige Pawnbrokers are blown away by two jaw-dropping diamond necklaces, owned by two very different clients. Single mum Marcella is looking for a better future for herself and her son and needs Ã‚Â£20,000 to kick-start her music career, while wealthy mother-of-four Ingrid wants to raise capital for her new horse importation and training business. They both hope that family heirlooms that have been gathering dust can kick-start their new lives. But following a closer inspection of one of the necklaces, there's a sleepless night for staff member Patrick, who suspects one could be fake. And Prestige MD James Constantinou is excited by a very unusual yellow mini submarine, which policeman David wants to sell. James tests it in a 'James Bond-style' underwater joyride, as he attempts to impress a potential buyer.\n\n3)  Part 3 \nJames has his work cut out sealing a deal with a pushy young entrepreneur who wants to borrow Ã‚Â£100,000 against his Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder. Legendary film director Ken Russell's ex-wife Hetty gets a shock when she tries to raise money by pawning her personal family photographs. A married couple get emotional as they look to pawn their pride and joy: a six-foot Kerry Darlington painting. A mum-of-three pawns her mother's diamond ring to support her family; but how much is the ring worth? And long-term client Tauren falls behind on his loan repayments. Will he lose his prized designer watch collection?\n\n4)  Part 4 \nReformed 1980s cat burglar Sid hopes to raise funds with help from his family and their jewellery. Prestige Pawnbrokers boss James gets the fright of his life when he test drives a client's superbike at Brands Hatch. New employee Kristen is put to the test when she has to value two huge tanzanite stones. And Prestige's PA and office manager Jo visits a client, Maggie, who, following a string of bad luck, including being diagnosed with cancer, can't pay back her loan, and is in danger of losing her late mother's jewellery. Touched by Maggie's unique situation, Jo tries to convince James to extend her loan one last time to save her precious jewellery. But can Jo talk shrewd businessman James around?\n\n5)  Part 5 \nEx-model Cathy is looking for a loan so she can launch a range of unusual women's lingerie. In the 1980s she shared the catwalk with the likes of Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss. Shortly after the birth of her two children Cathy was taken ill with Cushing's syndrome, which meant she gained an abnormal amount of weight. She has now recovered, and has raided her designer bag and jewellery collection in the hope of using them as collateral for a Ã‚Â£50,000 loan to launch her underwear business. But will she get the money she needs? Also in this episode, Prestige MD James gets some unwanted attention when he goes for a spin in a client's Ferrari, a young mum wants to pawn her grandfather's First World War medals to raise money for her mother's funeral, and an inventor turns up at Prestige to pawn his precious watch.\n\n6)  Part 6 \nA family man approaches Prestige Pawnbrokers with 12 classic cars to raise the money to avoid having his mansion repossessed, but it's another of his possessions that catches James's attention. A young drummer wants to cash in on a unique silver elephant his grandparents gave him to set up a recording studio so that he can stand on his own feet. A single mum parts with a five-carat diamond ring to give her boys a holiday; and a client who was adopted when she was three months old pawns her family heirlooms - including a sherry glass thought to have belonged to Queen Victoria - to raise money for a long-awaited trip to see her birth mother in Australia.\n\n7)  Part 7 \nJames' manoeuvring skills are put to the test as he test drives a client's 40-foot American motorhome. A self-confessed shopaholic hopes to sell two modern art paintings to pursue a new career in photography. A glamorous divorcee wants to sell some of her designer handbags to raise cash for her hair extensions business. And James and gem expert Kristen jet off to millionaires' playground Marbella to meet a glamorous client with some precious jewellery. James has a taste for the high life; can he drum up enough business to branch out overseas?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/5732/xem6.jpg&quot;
