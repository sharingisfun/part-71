To start with the obvious, they were the greatest and most influential act of the rock era, and introduced more innovations into popular music than any other rock band of the 20th century. Moreover, they were among the few artists of any discipline that were simultaneously the best at what they did and the most popular at what they did. Relentlessly imaginative and experimental, the Beatles grabbed hold of the international mass consciousness in 1964 and never let go for the next six years, always staying ahead of the pack in terms of creativity but never losing their ability to communicate their increasingly sophisticated ideas to a mass audience. Their supremacy as rock icons remains unchallenged to this day, decades after their breakup in 1970.\n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1989-2009\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded:............: Covers, Cues, Logs, Audiocheckers\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Harrison - Best Of Dark Horse 1976-1989 (1989)\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nGeorge Harrison's albums have been notoriously uneven, but despite the rough patches, his talent for songcraft never really left him, as the compilation The Best of Dark Horse (1976-1989) proves. A 15-song retrospective covering five albums, The Best of Dark Horse contains nearly every gem from 33 1/3, George Harrison, Somewhere in England, Gone Troppo, and Cloud Nine, including &quot;Crackerbox Palace,&quot; &quot;All Those Years Ago,&quot; &quot;Got My Mind Set on You,&quot; &quot;Cloud 9,&quot; &quot;When We Was Fab,&quot; and the lovely &quot;Blow Away.&quot; For most casual fans, the record will be a welcome summation of a hit-and-miss era of Harrison's career. \n\n\nGeorge Harrison - Let It Roll The Songs Of George Harrison (2009)\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nGeorge Harrison had two periods of great commercial success, separated by 15 years and two record labels, which is why there hasn't been a career-spanning Harrison collection until 2009's Let It Roll:The Best of George Harrison, the first disc to gather songs from Harrison's stints at both Apple and Dark Horse. Let It Roll balances these two periods, mixing it all up chronologically, so the set starts with the pristine bounce of &quot;Got My Mind Set on You&quot; before giving way to &quot;Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth.)&quot; If anything jars, it's the sounds of the times, as Jeff Lynne's clean arrangements don't necessarily fit with Phil Spector's lush productions, but that's a minor quibble about a compilation that consolidates Harrison's signature tunes onto one very enjoyable disc.\n\n\nJohn Lennon - The John Lennon Collection (Reissue) (1989)\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nThis 15-song collection (expanded to 19 in 1989 for the CD), released just short of two years after Lennon's death, provided a very generous overview of his solo career on a single LP, drawing on most of the major singles and also on songs that were widely covered, and from all periods of his career, from his late-Beatles-era solo political explorations up to the release of Double Fantasy. The producers, obviously working in collaboration with his widow and seeking to put the very best face on his career, and showcase his strongest and most memorable songs, pass right over Sometime in New York and much of the partly successful works that followed, which is sort of a shame -- &quot;Woman Is the Nigger of the World&quot; may not quite rate alongside the stuff that is here, but it was a song that he did care about and played live more than once (significant in a career that included barely any scheduled concerts), and &quot;John Sinclair&quot; showed him playing blues with a ferocious passion. One also misses &quot;Cold Turkey,&quot; which is as powerful a song as he wrote in his early solo career, but at the time of its release this was the broadest overview of Lennon's career to be found, and even included (on its CD version) the otherwise unanthologized B-side &quot;Move Over Ms. L.&quot; \n\n\nPaul McCartney - Wingspan Hits And History (2001)\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nPaul McCartney always got the short end of the stick when he was in the Beatles and again in the '70s, as he and his erstwhile partner John Lennon pursued solo careers. McCartney was attacked for his virtues -- for his melodicism and his domesticity, along with his desire to form a real touring band following the Beatles. None of these were celebrated at the time, but he moved many, many records and sold countless concert tickets, which only hardened opposition toward him. But, in retrospect, McCartney's albums make for the most fascinating body of work among any of the ex-Beatles, and really among any of his peers. Yes, there were pitfalls among the heights, but that's part of what makes his career so fascinating -- each record is distinctive, and even if the songs themselves are shallow, at least lyrically, the melodic skill and studio savvy behind each are hard not to admire. This may require a bit of conversion, and if you're not up to trudging through his individual works, even such masterworks as Ram (truly the roots of homemade pop), the double-disc set Wingspan is ideal. McCartney has had a number of career overviews before, including such seemingly comprehensive discs as All the Best, but those were plagued by vaguely haphazard sequencing. This is nearly perfectly executed, dividing McCartney's career between the &quot;hits&quot; and &quot;history,&quot; with the latter being devoted to album tracks that are acknowledged classics, yet never were singles. Now, it's true that this isn't completely comprehensive -- some will notice that superstar duets with Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson are missing, and others will wonder where such terrific latter-day singles as &quot;Press&quot; are or why such charting hits as &quot;So Bad&quot; are bypassed, or why album tracks like &quot;Ballroom Dancing&quot; are absent -- but nothing has come as close to capturing the quirky brilliance of McCartney's solo career, how it balanced whimsical pop with unabashedly sentimental romantic ballads, piledriving rockers, and anything in between. And what makes Wingspan so impressive is how the &quot;History&quot; disc fills in the gaps that &quot;Hits&quot; leaves, whether it's on the tremendous &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; (one of the very best songs he ever wrote), the charming &quot;Junk,&quot; the clever &quot;Take It Away,&quot; or such absolutely stunning miniatures as &quot;Heart of the Country,&quot; an effortless folk-pop tune that ranks among his very best songs. That's why Wingspan isn't just a good hits collection -- it's a convincing argument that McCartney's solo recordings are a rich, idiosyncratic body of work of their own merits. Ram, Red Rose Speedway, and London Town all have their merits, but if you need to be converted, this is where to start.\n\n\nRingo Starr - Photograph The Very Best Of Ringo Starr (2007)\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nHard as it is to believe but there has not been a proper Ringo Starr hits collection since the first, 1975's Blast from Your Past -- that's not counting 1989's Starr Struck: Best of Ringo Starr, Vol. 2, which was designed as a companion to that earlier set -- until 2007's Photograph: The Very Best of Ringo Starr. Blast from Your Past was released just five years after his debut, Sentimental Journey, but it ignored that collection of pop standards, along with much of its country cousin Beaucoups of Blues, winding up as a collection of highlights of 1973's Ringo and 1974's Goodnight Vienna, with a few non-LP hit singles rounded up within the LP's tight ten-track, 30-minute span. Ringo kept recording after Blast, working his way through several labels and ill-advised phases before settling into a nice, easy groove with 1993's Time Takes Time, but he stopped having hits not long after 1975, after the Elton John/Bernie Taupin &quot;Snookeroo&quot; climbed all the way to number three, capping off a remarkable streak of seven Top Ten singles. After that, the crash was fast: &quot;Oo-Wee&quot; was pulled off of Vienna and stalled at 31, then there was just one more hit -- &quot;A Dose of Rock &amp; Roll,&quot; peaking at 26 in 1976 -- before a five-year wait until the George Harrison-written &quot;Wrack My Brain&quot; limped to 38 in 1981 before Ringo disappeared from the charts. His '90s comeback may have never dented Billboard, but it is represented on the 20-track Photograph, which also contains all the aforementioned singles (apart from &quot;Oo-Wee,&quot; no great loss) and the entirety of Blast from Your Past, albeit presented in a different running order. This doesn't just make for a compilation that's longer than the 1975 set, it makes for one that's better, since it adds the terrific &quot;(It's All Down to) Good Night Vienna&quot; to the mix, along with the amiable 1976 cover of Bruce Channel's &quot;Hey Baby,&quot; a duet with Buck Owens on &quot;Act Naturally&quot; from 1989, and a well-chosen selection from each of Time Takes Time, 1998's Vertical Man, 2003's Ringorama, and 2005's Choose Love. This may not hit all the great stuff from the early '70s -- after all, the whole of Ringo is exceptionally strong -- but it does cut out all the real embarrassing stuff from the late '70s and just concentrates on the good latter-day material that holds its own with the best of his '70s hits. Far from merely being songs that are good when graded on a curve, these hits have aged really well, especially his originals: &quot;It Don't Come Easy,&quot; the thundering glam rocker &quot;Back Off Boogaloo,&quot; the cheerfully post-Beatles autobiography of &quot;Early 1970&quot; and &quot;Photograph,&quot; his gorgeous collaboration with George, which lends this comp its title and ranks as among the very best post-Beatles songs by any of the Fab Four. That tune proves Ringo could deliver music every bit as memorable as his colleagues and much of this excellent, long overdue compilation is at a similar high standard. [Photograph: The Very Best of Ringo Starr also includes entertaining track-by-track commentary from Ringo and was also released in a deluxe edition that contains a wonderful DVD with the videos for &quot;Sentimental Journey,&quot; &quot;It Don't Come Easy,&quot; &quot;Back Off Boogaloo,&quot; &quot;You're Sixteen,&quot; &quot;Only You (And You Alone)&quot; (which also features Harry Nilsson), and &quot;Act Naturally,&quot; along with an ad for Goodnight Vienna.\n\n\nRingo Starr - The Anthology...So Far (2001)\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nSpanning three discs and 47 tracks, The Anthology So Far collects highlights from all of Ringo Starr &amp; His All Starr Band tours, which means it doesn't just have hits from Ringo (basically, all of his solo and Beatles anthems), it also has signature songs from fellow classic rockers like Dr. John, Levon Helm, Rick Danko, Joe Walsh, John Entwistle, Dave Edmunds, Timothy B Schmidt, Felix Cavaliere, Randy Bachman, Burton Commings, Peter Frampton, Simon Kirke, Jack Bruce, Eric Carmen, and the great Todd Rundgren. In other words, this is the best of the oldies and, if it's taken for what it is, it's not bad. It's entertaining, well-performed, and filled with songs you know and (if you're listening to this) love. That doesn't make it necessary, of course, but it is a nostalgic good time if that's what you're looking for.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...
