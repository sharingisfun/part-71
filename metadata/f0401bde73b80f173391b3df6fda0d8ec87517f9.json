Luke is charged with the role of smiting the gathering dark forces of the world whilst trying to live an ordinary life of exams and parties.[4] Rupert Galvin helps train Luke with the assistance of Mina Harker, a blind vampiric concert pianist and authority on half-lives (i.e., vampires, demons, zombies, and werewolves). Luke's best friend Ruby also joins in on the action.[5]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0401bde73b80f173391b3df6fda0d8ec87517f9","amp;dn":"Demons+%28UK%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0401bde73b80f173391b3df6fda0d8ec87517f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,64,27,222,115,184,15,23,51,145,179,223,111,218,13,142,200,117,23,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
