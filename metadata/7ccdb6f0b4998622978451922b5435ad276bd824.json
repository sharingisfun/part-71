So complete that it even starts out with the &quot;intermission&quot; music played over the PA that night before the show started! Much has been written about the portion with Geddy pleading with the crowd to move back from the stage, so I won't comment on that...although I do think it's funny that he says if the stage does collapse, &quot;it's gonna be a big bummer&quot;. Some of the other interesting things I find with this recording include Alex tuning his guitar, himself, onstage, after the first song. (What, no roadie that night Al?) I also like Neil's german count-in to By-Tor: &quot;EIN! ZWEI!&quot; Overall a great recording. Nice and balanced with good instrument separation. Ged's vocals are great and the crew were putting some lovely effects on his voice that night. This is a must for every collection.  It's great to hear Circumstances live...I wish they'd play that one more often. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ccdb6f0b4998622978451922b5435ad276bd824","amp;dn":"Rush+1978-11-20.Tucson+FLAC+FM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ccdb6f0b4998622978451922b5435ad276bd824","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,205,182,240,180,153,134,34,151,132,81,146,43,84,53,173,39,107,216,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
