Among the first wave of American bands to become popular in the wake of the British invasion, the group combined rock, folk, and country music into a sound all its own. Its million-selling song &quot;For What It's Worth&quot; became a political anthem for the turbulent late 1960s.\n\nFormed in April 1966, Buffalo Springfield was plagued by infighting, drug-related arrests, and line-up changes that led to the group's disbanding after just two years. Three albums were released under its name, but many demos, studio outtakes, and live recordings remained and were issued in the decades that followed.[1]\n\nDespite the band's short tenure and limited output it was one of the most influential of its era, earning Rock and Roll Hall of Fame recognition and spawning fellow Hall honorees Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, as well as popular acts Poco and Loggins and Messina.\n\nMore: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Springfield\n\n1966 - Buffalo Springfield (1967, ATCO, SD 33-200-A, US, 24-96)\n1967- Buffalo Springfield Again [Original ATCO Yellow Vinyl] 24bit 96kHz\n1968 - Last Time Around (ATCO, SD 33-256, US, 24-96)\n\nArt included for all albums\n\nenjoy...\nSidmal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46fb2c0617007e7f0affe3d01add5ef7965a6586","amp;dn":"Buffalo+Spingfield++VinylRip%28+24%2F96%29+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46fb2c0617007e7f0affe3d01add5ef7965a6586","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,251,44,6,23,0,126,127,10,255,227,208,26,221,94,247,150,90,101,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
