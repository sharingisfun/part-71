In 1990, Dunn helped his own mother (who was adopted as a baby) locate her biological family, and that single event inspired him and his then-business partner to build an organization that did one thing: help people reunite with long-lost friends and family members. ``APB With Troy Dunn'' documents the work he does, which was previously filmed for WE TV's five-season run of ``The Locator.'' A more modern twist in ``APB,'' however, allows TNT viewers to use a social media app to contribute to Dunn's mission of bringing families and loved ones back together.\n\n\nFirst Aired: \tJanuary 31, 2014\nAir Day: \tFriday\nAir Time: \t9:00 PM\nRuntime: \t43 minutes\nNetwork: \tTNT\nGenre: \t        Reality\n\n\n\nEpisode Synopsis: A man learns the truth about his mother and siblings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a79bace6346d80ab50cc57ced79a612ba82dd81","amp;dn":"APB+With+Troy+Dunn+S01E03+Blood+Brothers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a79bace6346d80ab50cc57ced79a612ba82dd81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,121,186,206,99,70,216,10,181,12,197,124,237,121,166,18,186,130,221,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
