Use a recent version of VLC, MPC-HC, or XBMC. If you're using something other than a PC, good luck.\n\nQ: Is this English dubbed?\nA: Yes, but you have to switch the audio track and subtitles first. On XBMC, I recommend modifying your keyboard config to add a shortcut key.\n(http://www.maiman.net/2012/03/how-to-easily-switch-audio-languages-in-xbmc/)\n\nQ: This looks like crap.\nA: That's not a question. Go buy the official release if my encode isn't good enough.\n\nQ: How did you get the files to be so small?\nA: x264 is magical.\n\n\nIf you liked this show (how could you not?) then please buy the official DVDs or Blu-rays!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc0b7a3100ff159545bc05ba7cdfd1c88e9ef0f1","amp;dn":"%5BFiSH%5D+Clannad+%28Hi10P+Dual-Audio+480p+DVDRip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc0b7a3100ff159545bc05ba7cdfd1c88e9ef0f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,11,122,49,0,255,21,149,69,188,5,186,124,223,209,200,142,158,240,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
