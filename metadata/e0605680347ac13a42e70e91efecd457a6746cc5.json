Actually, it's Professor Jim Edwards, doctor of dunderheads. In the tradition of Will Hay, Edwards tries to maintain decorum in the boys' school where he serves as headmaster, but it's a losing battle. The fun really begins when the son of Edwards' bookie enrolls while disguised as a Middle-Eastern potentate. Producer/director Mario Zampi knows where the laughs are and knows how to get them in full measure\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0605680347ac13a42e70e91efecd457a6746cc5","amp;dn":"Bottems+Up++1960+B%2FW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0605680347ac13a42e70e91efecd457a6746cc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,96,86,128,52,122,193,58,66,231,14,145,239,236,212,87,166,116,108,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
