One of his boys, Chip is hiding stolen money sent by his father the outlaw leader King Blaine. After Blaine is killed, Chip decides to pay off Gabby's debt with this money, but trouble arises when the remaining gang members arrive looking for the loot.\n\nNotes - This is the 53 minute edited cut.\n\n==== Free Players ====\n\nGOM Media Player - http://player.gomlab.com/eng/\nVLC Media Player - http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html\n\n==== Technical Details ====\n\nNotes - I realize that this is a larger file size for this type/length/resolution of film. The source quality (a black and white film from 1946) was already something you would expect from an old film; grainy, poor lighting, poor sound quality. It was a struggle to not lose too much picture quality while trying to get a smaller file size. Even small decreases in quality became so noticeable due to the already poor source quality. I decided on opting for the larger file size to preserve as much quality as possible since losing just a little was so impactful.\n\nSong.of.Arizona.1946.Roy.Rogers.DVDRip.H264.AC3-CLP.m4v\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media / Version 2\nCodec ID                                 : mp42\nFile size                                : 1.33 GiB\nDuration                                 : 53mn 3s\nOverall bit rate                         : 3 585 Kbps\nEncoded date                             : UTC 2014-01-24 23:24:58\nTagged date                              : UTC 2014-01-25 00:00:13\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;88c0e1efe0c8c4bca6b9&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 8 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 53mn 3s\nBit rate                                 : 3 418 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 352 pixels\nHeight                                   : 482 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 4:3\nOriginal display aspect ratio            : 4:3\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 37.651 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 59.960 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.535\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : ac-3\nDuration                                 : 53mn 3s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 160 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\n\n\nEEEEEEE           jjj                \nEE      nn nnn         oooo  yy   yy \nEEEEE   nnn  nn   jjj oo  oo yy   yy \nEE      nn   nn   jjj oo  oo  yyyyyy \nEEEEEEE nn   nn   jjj  oooo       yy \n                jjjj          yyyyy  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a13472c5773000d2820c2a3c5b11bc13b3f96d9","amp;dn":"Song.of.Arizona.1946.Roy.Rogers.DVDRip.H264.AC3-CLP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a13472c5773000d2820c2a3c5b11bc13b3f96d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,19,71,44,87,115,0,13,40,32,194,163,197,177,27,193,59,63,150,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
