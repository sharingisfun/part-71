He was highly respected by Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven; \nthe latter two preferred him as conductor of their new works (e.g., Beethoven's First Symphony, in 1800). \nWranitzky was a prolific composer. His output comprises ten operas, 44 symphonies, at least 56 string quartets \n(some sources give a number as high as 73) and a large amount of other orchestral and chamber music. His opera, \nOberon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Fairy King from 1789 was a favorite in this genre and inspired Emanuel Schikaneder to write \nthe libretto of The Magic Flute for Mozart in 1791; in the mid-1790s, Goethe sought to collaborate with Wranitzky \non a sequel to the Mozart opera.\n\nWranitzky died in Vienna on September 29, 1808.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d34c00f77bc8daae1148ee05112948cb18f56a04","amp;dn":"Paul+Wranitzky%27s+Opera+-+Oberon+King+of+the+Elves","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d34c00f77bc8daae1148ee05112948cb18f56a04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,76,0,247,123,200,218,174,17,72,238,5,17,41,72,203,24,245,106,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
