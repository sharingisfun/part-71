It is implied that the title of the manga is derived from the &quot;good endings&quot; that are achieved in harem visual novels. Although the story was once concluded in the one shot version, the full version includes identical characters and settings.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e5de5a0f74564a40d3e670bff007907bb9f76bf","amp;dn":"GE%3A+Good+Ending+-+Vol.+04","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e5de5a0f74564a40d3e670bff007907bb9f76bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,93,229,160,247,69,100,164,13,62,103,11,255,0,121,7,187,159,118,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
