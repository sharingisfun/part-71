Sometimes an artist who has primarily worked in one application, Softimage for instance, finds that they need to be able to work in another program. These artists know what they need to accomplish and how to finish their projects, but they just need to know the capabilities of the new application and where they can quickly find the tools and functions they're looking for.\n\nRather than going through a long introductory project, with a lot of basic information, we'll cut straight to the information you need to start working quickly in CINEMA 4D. We'll talk about how CINEMA 4D deals with geometry and talk about its unique hierarchy based workflow.\n\nWe'll cover polygon modeling tools and workflows like Extruding, Beveling, and working with Deformers. We'll also cover the use of splines and generators to create geometry from those splines. We'll touch on UVs, animation, lighting, rendering and cover a few things unique to CINEMA 4D like multi-resolution sculpting and the MoGraph tools.\n\nIn the end you'll be able to take your Softimage knowledge and continue to work in CINEMA 4D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c146af31280047d1594a0d662547d529c80f653c","amp;dn":"CINEMA+4D+for+Softimage+Artists+DigitalTutors+720p+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c146af31280047d1594a0d662547d529c80f653c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,70,175,49,40,0,71,209,89,74,13,102,37,71,213,41,200,15,101,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
