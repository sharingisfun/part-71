Bang-up arrangements of the traditional numbers &quot;Dooley&quot; and &quot;Jones Oh Jones&quot; are other standout tunes missing from the original release. Whether this album-length re-release was intended as a stopgap or as a reward to fans who missed out on the EP back when it was still in print, the significant new song additions make Shinebox worth its purchase price.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97226ce48ac3eb9d3db93dbde08ccb8ba14c0278","amp;dn":"The+Gourds+-+Shinebox+%5B1998%5D%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97226ce48ac3eb9d3db93dbde08ccb8ba14c0278","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,34,108,228,138,195,235,157,61,185,61,189,224,140,203,139,161,76,2,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
