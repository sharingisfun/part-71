In this comprehensive comparative analysis of the transpacific alliance and its political, economic, and social foundations, Kent E. Calder, a leading Japan specialist, asserts that bilateral relations between the two countries are dangerously eroding as both seek broader options in a globally oriented world.\n\nCalder documents the quiet erosion of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multidimensional ties with Japan as China rises, generations change, and new forces arise in both American and Japanese politics. He then assesses consequences for a twenty-first-century military alliance with formidable coordination requirements, explores alternative foreign paradigms for dealing with the United States, adopted by Britain, Germany, and China, and offers prescriptions for restoring U.S.Ã¢â‚¬â€œJapan relations to vitality once again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49e3f444b2ccd2a1c44ca554eda3cd23f689e0a2","amp;dn":"Pacific+Alliance%3A+Reviving+US-Japan+Relations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49e3f444b2ccd2a1c44ca554eda3cd23f689e0a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,227,244,68,178,204,210,161,196,76,165,84,237,163,205,35,246,137,224,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
