A great amount of time has been spent on rewriting the dialogues in hopes of giving them a more fantasy-medieval style. New ambushes and text pop-ups have been added to previous chapters as well.\nThe A.I. is now smarter and deadlier. Heroes know how to use their Racial Synergy Bonus.\nWe also added three new units: the Frost Bat, the Chaos Dragon and the Rock Giant. Dwarves can now throw axes and wood-elves can train horse archers.\nLast but not least, this patch contains several bug fixes, including the Chaos Magic bug fix. See the changelog for more info.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98e754182d1d68bf6cb6a75db77000a6bf9ecc7b","amp;dn":"The+Protectors+beta+v0.8.1+patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98e754182d1d68bf6cb6a75db77000a6bf9ecc7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,231,84,24,45,29,104,191,108,182,167,93,183,112,0,166,191,158,204,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
