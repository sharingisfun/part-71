Making Believe\n\n________________________________________\n\n    It may be hard to believe but Willie Nelson wasn't always a national icon. In\n    the mid-'60s, he regularly hit the charts, except from behind the scenes as a\n    busy and acclaimed songwriter. His own recordings were less successful until,\n    in 1966, Country Favorites, Willie Nelson Style became his first album to\n    enter Billboard's country album charts, staying there 17 weeks and eventually\n    reaching number nine. Perhaps because the album is a collection of familiar\n    songs, Nelson's idiosyncratic vocals went over better -- or maybe his time\n    had just come -- but in any case, it's certainly a small treasure. Supporting\n    Nelson was Ernest Tubb's wonderful band the Texas Troubadours, who went\n    uncredited because they were under contract to a different record label. The\n    Troubadours' experience and sympathetic ears made a reliable backing for\n    Nelson as they tackled such material as &quot;San Antonio Rose,&quot; &quot;My Window Faces\n    the South,&quot; &quot;Heartaches by the Number,&quot; and &quot;Columbus Stockade Blues.&quot; There's\n    nothing cynical or calculated to their light swing and open-hearted feeling,\n    despite such a potentially unpromising album concept. Nelson had already\n    learned how to handle his unconventional voice effectively, giving these songs\n    the honest freshness and sharp sense of rhythm that would characterize his\n    later work. Like many rebels, Nelson has always shown a deep respect for\n    tradition; here he shares his affection with everyone.\n\n\n    -- Lang Thompson\n\n\n\n\n\n    This straight reissue of Willie's second album (from 1966) proves that\n    Nashville wasn't always unaware of how to handle him. Backed by the tightest\n    and jazziest edition of Ernest Tubb's Texas Troubadors, Nelson previews things\n    to come in the '70s while reviving 12 of his favorite Western swing standards\n    and barroom ballads. Wade Ray, who uncorks hellacious fiddle solos on &quot;Home\n    in San Antone&quot; and &quot;Columbus Stockade Blues,&quot; is an added attraction. Willie\n    is the very sound of sorrow and loss on gems like &quot;I'd Trade All of My\n    Tomorrows (For Just One Yesterday),&quot; &quot;Go On Home,&quot; and &quot;Don't You Ever Get\n    Tired (Of Hurting Me).&quot; He also turns in a robust &quot;FrÃƒÂ¤ulein,&quot; starts &quot;Seasons\n    of My Heart&quot; at the bottom of his range before modulating up effortlessly, and\n    reaches way down for &quot;Making Believe.&quot; Lead guitarist Leon Rhodes and steel\n    man Buddy Charlton provide solid support and superlative soloing.\n\n\n    -- John Morthland","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d073e3609fe4517faffd1483897de99f4a8e8948","amp;dn":"Willie+Nelson+-+Country+Favorites+-+Willie+Nelson+Style+%281966%29+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d073e3609fe4517faffd1483897de99f4a8e8948","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,115,227,96,159,228,81,127,175,253,20,131,137,125,233,159,74,142,137,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
