Is our world coming to an end as described in the Book of Revelation? By comparing the predictions to actual history, as well as to each other and by noting evidence of historical anachronisms and faulty scholarship on the part of fundamentalist apologists, Callahan subjects the prophecies of the Bible to four rigorous questions: 1) Is the prophecy true, false or too vague to be specifically interpreted? 2) If the prophecy is true was it written before or after the fact? 3) If it was written before the fact, was its fulfillment something that could be predicted based on a logical interpretation of the events of the prophet's day? 4) Was the prophecy directive or deliberately fulfilled by someone with knowledge of the prophecy?\n\n274 pages\nPublisher: Millennium Press\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0965504719\nISBN-13: 978-0965504713","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaf70025b891701aee3197639ae0ed348fce1d3a","amp;dn":"Bible+Prophecy%3A+Failure+or+Fulfillment%3F+by+Tim+Callahan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaf70025b891701aee3197639ae0ed348fce1d3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,247,0,37,184,145,112,26,238,49,151,99,154,224,237,52,143,206,29,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
