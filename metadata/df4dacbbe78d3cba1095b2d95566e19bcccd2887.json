The two sets feature many of Ditko's creepy-crawly terrors as well as highlighting his structured, almost enclosing art style that he was known for on Spider-Man and beyond. A real treat for fans of his work, and not to be missed.\n\nThese are both DCP editions scanned by UberSoldier. Thanks to them for their work, please seed and enjoy! :-)\n\nPlease visit and support my Suprbay release thread here, I would appreciate it: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-VikTSlick-s-Comics-Releases&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-VikTSlick-s-Comics-Releases&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df4dacbbe78d3cba1095b2d95566e19bcccd2887","amp;dn":"The+Steve+Ditko+Reader+v1-v2+%282004%7CUberSoldier-DCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df4dacbbe78d3cba1095b2d95566e19bcccd2887","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,77,172,187,231,141,60,186,16,149,178,217,85,102,225,155,204,205,40,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
