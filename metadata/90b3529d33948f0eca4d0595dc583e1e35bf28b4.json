It comes\nwith the update so you can play on new servers now that GameSpy is gone.  It\nalso comes with about 3GB of my favorite maps.\n\n--Install--\n1.  Open halocesetup_en_1.00.exe\n2.  When it asks for a key, use the one in key.txt\n3.  After the installation has finished, install haloce-patch-1.0.10.exe\n4.  Open the game.  If it works, go to step 7.\n5.  If you get a CD key error, move the files form &quot;haloce 1.0.10 fixed.zip&quot;\ninto your Halo CE folder.  This is typically &quot;C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft\nGamesHalo Custom Edition&quot; on 64 bit computers or &quot;C:Program FilesMicrosoft\nGamesHalo Custom Edition&quot; on 32 bit computers.\n6.  Browse to the &quot;contents&quot; folder that you just copied into the Halo CE\nfolder.  Delete loader.dll from this folder.\n7.  In your Halo CE folder, open &quot;redist&quot;.  Install of the dependencies of\nHalo CE from there.  Without this, you may not be able to chat, use the\nconsole, or load maps.\n8.  Restart for the DLLs to register.\n9.  You are good to go.\n10.  ????????\n11.  PROFIT!\n\n--Installing Maps--\n1.  Open maps.7z or download a map from http://hce.halomaps.org\n2.  Browse to your Halo CE folder.  Like I said earlier: This is typically &quot;C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft\nGamesHalo Custom Edition&quot; on 64 bit computers or &quot;C:Program FilesMicrosoft\nGamesHalo Custom Edition&quot; on 32 bit computers.\n3.  Open the maps folder, move the .map files from maps.7z or the file you\ndownloaded into the maps folder.\n4.  Restart/open Halo CE\n5.  Start a new LAN game to test the map\n6.  All done.\n\nYou can download more maps from http://hce.halomaps.org.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90b3529d33948f0eca4d0595dc583e1e35bf28b4","amp;dn":"Halo+CE+1.0.10+%2B+Maps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90b3529d33948f0eca4d0595dc583e1e35bf28b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,179,82,157,51,148,143,14,202,77,5,149,220,88,62,30,53,191,40,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
