Former NSA chief Keith B. Alexander is once again trying to justify the vast monitoring of millions of Americans by claiming that the odds for a future terrorist attack are increasing. \n\nAlso, the Washington Times is now covering Operation Choke Point, the Justice Department's ambitious new plan in which the DOJ is attempting to shut down gun shops by making it harder for them to perform financial transactions. \n\nOn today's show, the niece of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Dr. Alveda King, talks to Alex about the modern day black genocide as millions of African-American babies are aborted and what we can do to restore the sanctity of life in America.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
