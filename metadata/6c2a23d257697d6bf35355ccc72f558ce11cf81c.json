This album is basically out of print and as far as I could tell only available on youtube. This album predates Spencer's work on the Sega CD, and fans of his video game music (Ecco the Dolphin, Sonic CD) will likely enjoy this as well.\n\n\nArtist\t= Spencer Nilsen\nAlbum\t= Architects of Change\nYear\t= 1989\nGenre\t= New Age\nTracks\t= 10\n\n01 - Windows\n02 - Spoken Once...\n03 - Architects of Change\n04 - Pyramids\n05 - Spain By Horseback\n06 - Rain In The Lowlands\n07 - Church on Wally St.\n08 - Paper House\n09 - Healing The Dream\n10 - Windows (reprise)\n\n\nThis torrent includes the album as a single FLAC file with a cue sheet.
