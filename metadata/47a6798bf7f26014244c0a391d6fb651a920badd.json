The uniqueness of her angelic voice along with the sheer abundance of her songs have earned her a respected position in the Japanese music world, a position which might easily be called a genre in itself.\n\nMimoriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s originality when it comes to live performance deserves attention. Not only does she perform at concert halls, she also holds an annual series of concerts, to coincide with the blossoming of peach trees to celebrate Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girls FestivalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a Japanese tradition of celebrating the birth of baby girls. These concerts feature special guests with whom Mimori holds a live session. In addition, she sings songs, sometimes nostalgic songs, which she feels like singing, not only her own creations. Another type of performance is entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“BonbonniereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. This is a piano solo type of concert held in a casual atmosphere. It features Mimori conversing with the audience, and is infused with her unique brand of humor. It is said that these informal gatherings are somewhat addictive.\n\n\nMimoriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s major hits include &quot;Chizu o kudasai&quot; (Give me a Map), used in 1989 in a Nisshin Cup Noodle commercial featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“KuroÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, used in 2005 on an NHK program, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Minna no UtaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nAlmost complete discography:\n\n1988 - Ã§Å¾Â³Ã¦Â°Â´Ã¦â„¢Â¶ (Hitomisuisho)\n1988 - Ã§Â©ÂºÃ¨â‚¬Â³Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã¤Â¸Ëœ (Soramimi on the Hill)\n1989 - Ã£Æ’ï¿½Ã£Æ’Â«Ã£Æ’Â¢Ã£Æ’â€¹Ã£â€šÂªÃ£Æ’â€¡Ã£â€šÂªÃ£Æ’Â³ (Harmoniodeon)\n1990 - HOPE\n1991 - Ã£Æ’Â¢Ã£â€šÂ¶Ã£â€šÂ¤Ã£â€šÂ¯ (Mosaic)\n1992 - Ã¦Â¡Æ’Ã£ï¿½Â¨Ã¨â‚¬Â³ (Momo to Mimi)\n1993 - momoism\n1994 - Ã¦Â°Â´Ã¨â€°Â² (Water Blue)\n1994 - Ã£â€šÂ¢Ã£Æ’Â«Ã£Æ’â€™Ã£Æ’ï¿½Ã£Æ’Â¬Ã£Æ’Å½Ã£Æ’â€™ (Alui-Halenohi)\n1996 - Ã£â€šÂ¢Ã£â€šÂ«Ã£â€šÂ·Ã£â€šÂ¢ (Acacia)\n1997 - roka\n1998 - ECHO\n1998 - mimomemo - the memorable songs of mimori yusa\n1999 - Ã¥ÂºÂ­ (Niwa)\n2000 - Small is Beautiful\n2001 - honoka\n2001 - still life\n2002 - Ã¦ÂªÂ¸Ã¦ÂªÂ¬ (Lemon)\n2002 - TRAVELOGUE sweet and bitter collection\n2003 - Bougainvillea\n2006 - Ã¤Â¼â€˜Ã¦Å¡â€¡Ã¥Â°ï¿½Ã¥Â±â€¹ (Kyuukagoya)\n2008 - Ã£â€šÂ¹Ã£Æ’Â°Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’Ë†Ã¦ÂªÂ¸Ã¦ÂªÂ¬ (Sweet Lemon)\n2009 - Ã©Å â‚¬Ã¦Â²Â³Ã¦â€°â€¹Ã¥Â¸â€“ (Cahier de Ginga)\n2010 - Do-Re-Mimo ~the singles collection~\n2013 - VIOLETTA THE BEST OF 25 YEARS\n\nThis discography is almost complete because I'm still missing:\n\n- Bougainvillea Reflect (2003)\n- BREATH at the show (2004)\n- mimori yusa concert 2009\nand Ã¦Â·Â¡Ã©â€ºÂª Light Snowfall (2012) (and consequently VIOLETTA CD1 track 14)\n\nEnjoy, and please support this great artist\nOfficial site: http://www.mimoriyusa.net/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47a6798bf7f26014244c0a391d6fb651a920badd","amp;dn":"Mimori+Yusa+-+almost+complete+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47a6798bf7f26014244c0a391d6fb651a920badd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,166,121,139,247,242,96,20,36,76,10,57,29,111,182,81,169,32,186,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
