Allan Brocka. A spin-off from Brocka's 1999 short film of the same name, the series premiered on LOGO in July 2007 and ended in January 2009.\n\nThe series follows the lives of three gay couplesÃ¢â‚¬â€the titular Rick and Steve, Chuck and Evan, and Dana and KirstenÃ¢â‚¬â€as they live in the fictional gay ghetto of West Lahunga Beach and interact with their friends and family. The title is ironic, as all three of the main couples have typical &quot;couple issues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ including Steve actively seeking a three-way with Rick and another man, Kirsten and Dana deciding to have a baby with Rick's sperm, and Chuck and Evan simply trying to be together despite a 31-year age difference between them.\n\nThe show features the voices of Will Matthews (Rick), Peter Paige (Steve), Emily Brooke Hands and Jessica-Snow Wilson (Kirsten), Taylor M. Dooley (Dana), Alan Cumming (Chuck), Wilson Cruz (Evan), and other assorted celebrities (i.e. Margaret Cho, Lorna Luft, RuPaul, Lance Bass, Andy Dick, Bruce Vilanch, Mark Hamill, and George Takei, among others).\n\nThe show is noted particularly for its use of an adult-oriented and &quot;politically incorrect&quot; style of humor, similar in some respects to that of &quot;South Park&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot;.\n\nAll 14 episodes are here in MP4 format.\n\nSeason 1:\n1. Guess Who's Coming for Quiche?\n2. Bush Baby\n3. Damn Straights\n4. It's Raining Pussy\n5. Save Our Seamen\n6. Hormonally Yours\n\nSeason 2:\n7. Labor Days\n8. Wickeder\n9. Mom Fight\n10. Death of a Lesbian Bed\n11. Swallowing Pride\n12. House of Race Cards\n13. The Only Straight in the Village\n14.
