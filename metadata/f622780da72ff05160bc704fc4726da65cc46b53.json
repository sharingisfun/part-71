The credit here goes to Debian, Ubuntu, the MATE team, and the linux community in general. I believe there is too much confusion surrounding linux, holding the new user back from enjoying the world of open source right away.\n\nSockPuppet is pre-configured with ease of use in mind. This release has been kept to a minimal size with just essential applications installed, getting you up in running in minutes of clicking the installer. SockPuppet 4.0 is a complete rework from previous SP releases but still MATE only, no Unity, no GNOME 3, just the lightweight GNOME2 fork giving you a familiar stable desktop experience. All packages are up to date at 3.2.0-58. Included in the live environment are tutorials for post-install tips as well as a Ubuntu Beginners Guide. The seasoned distro-hopper will find SockPuppet 4.0 a fast booting live environment perfect for installing across a wider range of hardware than default buntu, a perfect building block for your system.\n\n\nImages \n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://imageshack.com/a/img600/2956/32l9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imageshack.com/a/img600/2956/32l9.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img546/1254/ztp1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img546/1254/ztp1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img833/6522/qde4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img833/6522/qde4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img854/1517/dnnh.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img854/1517/dnnh.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img594/6192/5eo7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img594/6192/5eo7.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img849/795/atg2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img849/795/atg2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPost Install Vid\n\n\n\nLive Login\n\n\nUsername: live\n\nPassword: [enter]\n\n\n\nThe Open Linux Forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f622780da72ff05160bc704fc4726da65cc46b53","amp;dn":"SockPuppet_4.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f622780da72ff05160bc704fc4726da65cc46b53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,34,120,13,167,47,240,81,96,188,112,79,196,114,109,166,92,196,107,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
