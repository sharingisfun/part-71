It's free leech as of now (don't know how long it will be free leech so grab it now!) and a great quality video.\nSample at:\n\nWillie's music is very special to me. Out of my 1000+ records his album &quot;Streets of New York&quot; is one of my most played ones.\n\nThe video is mainly a 2cam mix. I filmed the whole show except three minutes of &quot;House of a thousand guitars&quot; where silly me though I was recording but I was not. My friend recorded that song but thought I was filming the &quot;secure&quot; angle so he was moving the camera around a lot. Still very enjoyable.\nPlease note: My friend filmed not all of the show but a lot so this is mainly a 2cam mix. Both cameras set to 1080p-50 and for this blu-ray edited to 1080i/30 NTSC for worldwide playback. The lightning was horrible for recording but it's a great club with great sound. Highly recommended. Check out the &quot;Blue Notez&quot; in Dortmund if you are looking for a nice concert setting.\nAudio source: CA14 cards - CA ugly II pre-amp - Tascam DR-2d @ 24/96\n\nfilmed by:\nDVDDUBBINGGUY\nBruce83filming\n\naudio recording by:\nDVDDUBBINGGUY\n\nedited by:\nDVDDUBBINGGUY\n\nphotos by:\nGundula BÃƒÂ¶ttger Front Row Photopgraphy (http://nuna.eastcoastmusic.de/)\n\nSetlist:\nThis is our time\nLife on Bleecker street\nThe innocent ones\nHeaven help the lonely\nHoly war\nNot fade away (Buddy Holly)\nGrenade\nGive me tomorrow\nLove is a train\nSweet Jane (The Velvet Underground)\nHouse of a thousand guitars\nPeople who died\nOne guitar\nCalifornia sun (Ramones)\n\nBONUS: \nJefferson Grizzard - Lorelei (from Willie's support act)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ede5d49526af116d7eb80c032c3c455cd86e1248","amp;dn":"Willie+Nile+2013-11-28+Dortmund+blu-ray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ede5d49526af116d7eb80c032c3c455cd86e1248","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,229,212,149,38,175,17,109,126,184,12,3,44,60,69,92,216,110,18,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
