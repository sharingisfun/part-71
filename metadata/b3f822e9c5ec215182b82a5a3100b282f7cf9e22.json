She leaves behind her childhood spent in hiding during the years of the military dictatorship. She also leaves Petra, her seven year old sister. Two decades later, Petra also becomes an actress and goes to New York in search of Elena. She only has a few clues about her: home movies, newspaper clippings, a diary and letters. At any moment Petra hopes to find Elena walking in the streets in a silk blouse. Gradually, the features of the two sisters are confused; we no longer know one from the other. When Petra finally finds Elena in an unexpected place, she has to learn to let her go.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3f822e9c5ec215182b82a5a3100b282f7cf9e22","amp;dn":"Elena+2012+720p.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3f822e9c5ec215182b82a5a3100b282f7cf9e22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,248,34,233,197,236,33,81,130,184,42,90,49,0,178,130,247,207,158,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
