Illustrator is one of those tools, noteworthy for its type tools, spacious artboard, libraries of reusable artwork, and clean vector lines. In this course, Justin Putney shows how to use symbols to take advantage of reusability, organize your artwork into layers, use artboards to design different wireframes for multiple screens and different application states, and export wireframes to share with clients and developers.\nTopics include:\n\n    Creating and positioning guides\n    Building shapes\n    Designing reusable symbols\n    Creating character and paragraph styles\n    Adding text\n    Using artboards to organize and display content\n    Exporting to multipage PDF\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd8324056011665cc05af025fde0fcf9ed1ff986","amp;dn":"LYNDA_UX_DESIGN_TOOLS_ILLUSTRATOR_TUTORIAL-kEISO.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd8324056011665cc05af025fde0fcf9ed1ff986","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,131,36,5,96,17,102,92,192,90,240,37,253,224,252,249,237,31,249,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
