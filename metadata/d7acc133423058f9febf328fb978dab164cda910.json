This May, a tidal wave of Made in Japan reissues are surging your way, from remasters to expansions to box sets on CD, vinyl and Blu-Ray.\nIn 1972, Deep Purple were flying higher than ever. The quintet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at the time, singer Ian Gillan, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, bassist Roger Glover, keyboardist Jon Lord and drummer Ian Paice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ had just released their sixth album in five years (and third with the Mk II lineup), Machine Head. It was their first chart-topper in their native England, and also went Top 10 in the States. By this time, the band had quite a sterling reputation as a live act, but were reluctant to attempt a live album for fear they could not produce the exact kind of polished set they could in studio.\n\nUltimately, upon discovering a burgeoning bootleg market around their tours, they relented, recording three consecutive nights in Osaka and Tokyo, Japan (where the band were particularly adored). Focusing solely on putting on a great show and less on how the final product would sound (to this day, members of the band have reportedly never heard the album), Deep PurpleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gamble paid off handsomely. A single backed with both studio and live versions of the instant classic (and arguable progenitor of heavy metal) Ã¢â‚¬Å“Smoke on the WaterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was a U.S. Top 5 hit. The album went Top 10 in America and Top 20 in England, eventually earning a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America for over a million units shipped.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7acc133423058f9febf328fb978dab164cda910","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Made+in+Japan+%5B5CD+Deluxe+Edition%5D+%282014%29+MP3%40320k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7acc133423058f9febf328fb978dab164cda910","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,172,193,51,66,48,88,249,254,191,50,143,185,120,218,177,100,205,169,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
