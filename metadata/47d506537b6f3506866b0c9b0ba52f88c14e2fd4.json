It is notable for an elaborately staged crane shot Hitchcock devised towards the end of the film, which identifies the real murderer.\n\nCAST:-\nNova Pilbeam as Erica Burgoyne\nDerrick De Marney as Robert Tisdall\nPercy Marmont as Colonel Burgoyne\nEdward Rigby as Old Will\nMary Clare as Erica's Aunt\nJohn Longden as Inspector Kent\nGeorge Curzon as Guy\nBasil Radford as Erica's Uncle\nPamela Carme as Christine\nGeorge Merritt as Detective Sergeant Miller\nJ.

Christine slaps him several times across the face, but he hardly reacts, choosing instead to depart without a word.\n\nThe next morning, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney) happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore. He runs to get help and call the police, but two young swimmers arrive just in time to see him racing away from the corpse. A belt from his raincoat, which had just recently gone missing, is found next to the body, further implicating him in her strangling. He is subsequently arrested and becomes the main suspect, partly because of a large sum of money Christine left to him in her will, a gift he was unaware of. Saddled with a despondent barrister, Tisdall doubts if his innocence will ever be established. He elects to take advantage of a crowded courthouse and make his escape.\n\nTisdall coerces Erica Burgoyne (Nova Pilbeam), daughter of the local police Chief Constable, to give him a ride in her Morris car. Though she is initially unsure about her passenger, Burgoyne eventually becomes convinced of his innocence and elects to help him in any way that she can. They are eventually spotted together, forcing both to stay on the run. Tisdall tries to prove his innocence by tracking down the stolen coat.\n\nThe duo succeed in tracking down Old Will (Edward Rigby), a sociable china-mender and bum that was known to have received Tisdall's coat. He agrees to help them find the man who gave him the coat; unfortunately, all that Old Will can remember about the man is his distinctive eye twitch.\n\nUpon searching the pockets of the coat, Erica finds a box of matches from the Grand Hotel, a place Tisdall has never been to. She is separated from the group, however, and taken in by the police. Upon realising that his daughter has fully allied herself with the murder suspect, her father chooses to resign his position as Chief Constable rather than arrest her for assisting Tisdall. Nonetheless, Erica and Old Will go to the Grand Hotel together, hoping to find the true murderer. In a memorably long, continuous sequence, the camera moves forward through the hotel ballroom, finally focusing on the drummer in a dance band performing in blackface. Recognizing Old Will in the audience, and seeing policemen nearby (unaware that they have followed Old Will in the hopes of finding Tisdall), the man performs poorly due to fear and a drug he has been taking to try to control the twitching, and is berated by the musical conductor. Eventually the drummer faints in the middle of a performance, drawing the attention of Erica and the policemen. Immediately after being revived and confronted, he confesses his crime and begins laughing hysterically.\n\n=============================================================================================\n\nAlfred Hitchcock Classics - Easy Virtue (1928) Silent Movie\n\nEasy Virtue is a 1928 British silent romance film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Isabel Jeans, Franklin Dyall and Ian Hunter.\n\nThe movie is loosely based on the 1924 play Easy Virtue by NoÃƒÂ«l Coward.

In a flashback, her husband, a drunken brute named Aubrey (Franklin Dyall), is drinking from that decanter. His drunkenness prevents her portrait from being painted. Meanwhile, the painter, Claude (Eric Bransby Williams), is smitten with Larita and attempts to seduce her when her husband leaves. She rejects Claude's advances, but Aubrey walks in on them and Claude and Claude dies. Aubrey files for divorce on the grounds of adultery, which is why Larita is court this day. The juries decides in Aubrey's favor, considering the proof that Claude left Larita his entire fortune.\n\nSince she is now a disgraced woman of &quot;easy virtue&quot;, Larita leaves for the French Riviera to avoid attention. During a tennis match, she meets a rich younger man, John Whittaker (Robin Irvine), and soon marries him. Even though they are madly in love, she does not tell him about her past, and they return to England to meet his family. While friends and family seem to like Lartia, his mother strongly disapproves of her, having recognized Larita's face from the papers. She questions John about where Larita comes from, but he does not have any answers.\n\nJohn's mother remains suspicious about Larita, and makes her life miserable. Larita begs John to go back to the south of France, but he does not understand why she is so unhappy in England. She feels his family hates her and they are teaching him to hate her, too. Later that day, John admits to his family that he made a mistake marrying Larita.\n\nThen, John's mother sees Larita's face in the papers, and Larita's past comes to light. The family confronts Laurita, with his mother telling her that, &quot;In our world, we do not understand this code of easy virtue.&quot; During a party the family hosts, the family tries to keep Larita upstairs, but she comes down anyway. She realizes how unwanted she is and decides to allow John to divorce her so he can marry Sarah (Enid Stamp Taylor), a local girl whom his mother had in mind as a suitable match.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4999 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English\nRunTime 162 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 162 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47d506537b6f3506866b0c9b0ba52f88c14e2fd4","amp;dn":"Alfred+Hitchcock+Classics+-+Young+and+Innocent+%281937%29+-+Easy+Vir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47d506537b6f3506866b0c9b0ba52f88c14e2fd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,213,6,83,123,111,53,6,134,107,12,155,11,165,47,136,193,78,47,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
