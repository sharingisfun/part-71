This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThere an artist who found success doing remakes of old hits by other artists. He finally made it to number one with a song he wrote, but his current song is another remake.\n\nBuchanan and Goodman had a hit in 1956, with a &quot;flying-saucer&quot; type record. One member of that team is back with another 45 that samples other hit songs.\n\nThere is the latest hit for a duo that have never missed the top 20, except for the time they remade a former Beatles number one and didn't even make the top 40.\n\nThere is a hit by an artist whose former band broke up three years ago and still has two top five albums on the LP chart.\n\nA listener wants to know what number one song had the shortest title and which had the longest. Casey says the longest title had 41 letters, while the shortest only had 2.\n40: Let's Pretend - Raspberries\n39: No More Mr. Nice Guy - Alice Cooper\n38: Blue Suede Shoes - Johnny Rivers\n37: Teddy Bear Song - Barbara Fairchild\n36: I Can Understand It - The New Birth\n35: Super Fly Meets Shaft - John &amp; Ernest\n34: Right Place Wrong Time - Dr. John\n33: Ain't No Woman (Like The One I've Got) - Four Tops\n32: Armed And Extremely Dangerous - First Choice\n31: &quot;Cherry Cherry&quot; From Hot August Night - Neil Diamond\n30: Leaving Me - The Independents\n29: It Sure Took A Long, Long Time - Lobo\n28: I'm Doing Fine Now - New York City\n27: Playground In My Mind - Clint Holmes\n26: Steamroller Blues - Elvis Presley\n25: Masterpiece - The Temptations\n24: I'm Gonna Love You Just A Bit More Baby - Barry White\n23: Peaceful - Helen Reddy\n22: Thinking Of You - Loggins &amp; Messina\n21: The Right Thing To Do - Carly Simon\n20: Walk On The Wild Side - Lou Reed\n19: Funky Worm - Ohio Players\n18: Out Of The Question - Gilbert O' Sullivan\n17: Hocus Pocus - Focus\n16: Sing - Carpenters\n15: Daisy A Day - Jud Strunk\n14: Pillow Talk - Sylvia\n13: My Love - Paul McCartney &amp; Wings\n12: Wildflower - Skylark\n11: Reeling In The Years - Steely Dan\n10: The Twelfth Of Never - Donny Osmond\n9: Daniel - Elton John\n8: The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia - Vicki Lawrence\n7: Frankenstein - Edgar Winter Group\n6: Stuck In The Middle With You - Stealers Wheel\n5: Drift Away - Dobie Gray\n4: The Cisco Kid - War\n3: Little Willie - The Sweet\n2: You Are The Sunshine Of My Life - Stevie Wonder\n1: Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round The Ole Oak Tree - Dawn featuring Tony Orlando\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f083a17abfbc5653632732cd66786933fce84d23","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1973_May_12th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f083a17abfbc5653632732cd66786933fce84d23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,131,161,122,191,188,86,83,99,39,50,205,102,120,105,51,252,232,77,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
