The elder son is Pratap (N T Ramarao) and younger son is Jagajjit (Lanka Satyam). Pratap dreams of marrying Devakanyas (Indra Kumari, Varuna Kumari, Naga Kumari and Agni Kumari) and happily enjoying life. Knowing this, the angered father expels him from the country. He continues his journey with friend Rendu Chintalu (Relangi) in search of Devakanyas and reaches a pond wherein they bathe regularly. He secretly observes them but gets cursed by Jayanthi (B Saroja Devi) to become a statue. He regains his body by the pious activity of his mother Maharani (Rushyendramani). Meanwhile Indraputri was also cursed by a Muni to stay in Manavaloka and marry a person who steals her dress. Knowing about the curse, Pratap steals her dress and runs away without looking backwards. He marries Jayanthi and reaches the Kamakuta Rajya. The king is Threesokanandu (Rajanala), who eyes Jayanthi and sends Pratap to Naga Lokam and Varuna Lokam on the pretext of fetching Medicine for him. Meanwhile Pratap marries Naga Kanya and Varuna Kanya and puts an end to Threesokanandu. When Pratap is away to win his kingdom back, his four wives cheat their Mother-in-law to help Jayanthi procure her saree back so all devakanyas could go to heaven. However they could not forget him. Pratap goes in search of Devakanyas and reaches heaven and Indrasabha. Indra and other devas test his efficiency and love towards their daughters. He succeeds and gets the Devakanyas to Earth and rules the kingdom happily.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Bitrate: 1295 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Telugu\nRunTime: 3:01:03\nSubtitles: English\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 3:01:03","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f66005810e36372f662fef1347bb6bda07f51ee","amp;dn":"Jagadeka+Veeruni+Katha+%281961%29+Telugu+Xvid+2cd+-+Eng+Subs+-+NTR%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f66005810e36372f662fef1347bb6bda07f51ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,102,0,88,16,227,99,114,246,98,254,241,52,123,182,189,160,127,81,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
