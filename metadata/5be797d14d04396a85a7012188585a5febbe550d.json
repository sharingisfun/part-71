Unlike in Iceland and other countries where civil unrest breaks out over corrupt politicians and bankster behavior, Seattle residents rioted in &quot;celebration&quot; of the Seahawks' victory. \n\nJesse Ventura, former Minnesota Governor and author of They Killed Our President, joins the show to discuss these latest developments, the current explosion in alternative media and the real news behind current events.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
