The show was also the #1 new show of the season until CBS' Criminal Minds surpassed it. Its major competitor in the 9:00 p.m. timeslot was FOX's House, which aired after American Idol.\n\nThe series was created by American director Rod Lurie, director of the films The Contender and Deterrence and may have been inspired by The West Wing, a popular political drama on rival NBC.\n\nThe network replaced Lurie with Steven Bochco as show runner,[1] but declining ratings brought about a hiatus, a timeslot change and ultimately cancellation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dd0e3e587abbe40805e577586ea84c560a113f8","amp;dn":"Commander+in+Chief","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dd0e3e587abbe40805e577586ea84c560a113f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,208,227,229,135,171,190,64,128,94,87,117,134,234,132,197,96,161,19,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
