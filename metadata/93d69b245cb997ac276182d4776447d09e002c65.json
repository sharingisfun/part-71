Eladjoe\n\nI am in the military stationed overseas and we do not have access to country music radio here, but after purchasing Totally Country, I realized how much fantastic music I've missed over the last 2 years. I did not know many of the artists in this collection except for Brooks &amp; Dunn, Travis Tritt and of course Kenny Rogers and Dwight Yoakam. So I had no biases when I popped in the cd and listened, the music speaks for itself:\n\n1. &quot;Only in America&quot; - Brooks &amp; Dunn - Wow what a chorus! This song is every bit as \ngood as their old stuff. It makes me proud to be serving my county!\n\n2. &quot;She Couldn't Change Me&quot; - Montgomery Gentry - I love this song because it reminds me of my girlfriend.\n\n3. &quot;With Me&quot; - Lonestar - Great song, strong chorus and I love that fiddle, now I'm a Lonestar fan!\n\n4. &quot;Without you&quot; - Dixie Chicks - I always thought the Dixie Chicks were a bit overrated, but this song is simply beautiful.\n\n5. &quot;On a Night Like This&quot; - Trick Pony - Never heard of them. But the singer has a really sexy voice, I'd like to hear more of their stuff.\n\n6. &quot;I Lost it&quot; - Kenny Chesney - My favorite song on this album. What a voice! The best chorus I heard in while.\n\n7. &quot;Angels in Waiting&quot; - Tammy Cochran - Its okay,if this song wasn't on this cd, I wouldn't miss it.\n\n8. &quot;Born to Fly&quot; - Sara Evans - See 7#\n\n9. &quot;Austin&quot; - Blake Shelton - I love this song, I have this thing for story songs. \nIt makes me want to change my answering machine message!\nnull &quot;It's a Great Day to be Alive&quot; - Travis Tritt - I'm not a big Travis Tritt fan...what is this song about?\n\n14. &quot;I want you to want me&quot; - Dwight Yoakam - I like it, but the original version was better.\n\n15. &quot;The Little Girl&quot; - John Michael Montomery - If this song doesn't make you cry then there is something wrong with you. Gorgeous song.\n\n16. &quot;Buy Me a Rose&quot; - Kenny Rogers - I'm so impressed, Kenny sounds exactly like he did 30 years ago. Nice advice, for men who don't have any good gift ideas.\n\n17. &quot;There You Are&quot; - Martina McBride - Okay song, I can imagine Celine Dion singing this song...is this country?\n\nOverall this a great cd for someone who is getting into modern country, or who is getting back into it. Highly recommended!\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                        VA - Totally Country\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: Totally Country\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2002\n\nMP3 320cbr\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
