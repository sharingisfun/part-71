Though their attraction to vintage electronics places them in league with groups such as Add N (To X) and Stereolab, most of Plone's songs actually sound like they were recorded during the late '60s or early '70s -- the basslines are undoubtedly chunkier, and there's a bit more clutter to the productions, but the melodies are simplistic and in the forefront while the tempos rarely make it over 60 bpm. At times, Plone sounds reminiscent of Mouse on Mars or like a Spartan version of Air, but the general drift of the proceedings is much closer to Esquivel than Autechre.
