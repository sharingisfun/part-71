It is implied that the title of the manga is derived from the &quot;good endings&quot; that are achieved in harem visual novels. Although the story was once concluded in the one shot version, the full version includes identical characters and settings.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f893ec0ce727f84364deeb008c7ce153503bcc00","amp;dn":"GE%3A+Good+Ending+-+Vol.+05","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f893ec0ce727f84364deeb008c7ce153503bcc00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,147,236,12,231,39,248,67,100,222,235,0,140,124,225,83,80,59,204,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
