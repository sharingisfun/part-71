Managed by ArsÃƒÂ¨ne Wenger in his first full season, the club ended the campaign winning the league championship for the first time in seven years. At Wembley Stadium, Arsenal beat Newcastle United 2Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0 in the 1998 FA Cup Final to win the competition and complete a domestic double Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the first in the club's history since 1970Ã¢â‚¬â€œ71. Arsenal exited the Football League Cup in the semi-finals to Chelsea and lost on aggregate score to PAOK in the UEFA Cup first round.\nIn the transfer window, Arsenal purchased several players, including midfielders Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit and goalkeeper Alex Manninger; English midfielder Paul Merson departed to join Middlesbrough. Arsenal began the league season relatively well, but a run of three defeats in four matches between November and December 1997 left the team in sixth position before Christmas, and seemingly out of championship contention. Although they were 12 points behind reigning champions Manchester United at the end of February, a winning streak of nine matches ensured Arsenal won the championship with a 4Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0 win over Everton on 3 May 1998. In recognition of the team's achievement, Wenger was awarded the Carling Manager of the Year award and striker Dennis Bergkamp was given the accolade of PFA Players' Player of the Year by his fellow peers and FWA Footballer of the Year by football writers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c916481eecd1667544417f55eaa1120924484d72","amp;dn":"Arsenal+FC+Official+Season+Review+1997%2F98+-+Boring+Boring+Arsena","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c916481eecd1667544417f55eaa1120924484d72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,22,72,30,236,209,102,117,68,65,127,85,234,161,18,9,36,72,77,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
