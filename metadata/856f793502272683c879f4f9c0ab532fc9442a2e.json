They are the hope of the 21st century. Just as the workplace in this new century is vastly different from days gone by, so too must our teaching and learning environments be different to accommodate the growing and innovative needs of a global workplace. Management 12/e introduces the essentials of management as they apply within the contemporary and global work environment. The subject matter is carefully chosen to meet AACSB accreditation guidelines while still allowing extensive flexibility to fit various course designs and class sizes. There are many new things to look for in this edition. Along with updates of core material, Management 12/e offers a number of changes in the organization, content, and design that respond to current themes and developments in the theory and practice of management.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:856f793502272683c879f4f9c0ab532fc9442a2e","amp;dn":"+++++Introduction+to+Management+12th+Edition+by+John+R.+Schermer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"856f793502272683c879f4f9c0ab532fc9442a2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,111,121,53,2,39,38,131,200,121,244,249,192,171,83,47,201,68,42,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
