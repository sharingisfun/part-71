In January 1982, Icehouse founder Iva Davies started recording Primitive Man essentially as a solo project, it was co-produced with Keith Forsey who later worked with Simple Minds and Billy Idol. Forsey supplied additional percussion; Davies supplied vocals, lead guitar, keyboards (Sequential Circuits Prophet-5), bass guitar and programmed the Linn drum machine. Released as an Icehouse album, Primitive Man reached #3 on the National album charts and provided their international breakthrough single, &quot;Hey Little Girl&quot; which peaked at #7 in Australia,[6] #2 in Switzerland, #5 in Germany, Top 20 in UK, Sweden and Netherlands, and #31 on the U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.
