In some cases, such as nose bleeds, large bruises and heavy menses, it is the clinician's responsibility to discern whether the patient has a clinically significant bleeding disorder that may predispose to excessive or potentially serious bleeding. Fast Facts: Bleeding Disorders keeps a complex subject simple and clinically oriented. The authors have made numerous updates to this second edition to ensure it provides essential information in a readily accessible format. Highlights include: - An expert overview of normal hemostasis - A clear assessment pathway, from taking an accurate history and focused clinical examination, to essential laboratory investigations - Objective criteria for diagnosing hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia - The latest guidelines on diagnosing and treating primary immune thrombocytopenia - A discussion of the benefits of prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia - Updated methods for evaluating and treating bleeding disorders in pregnancy - An overview of the scoring system for disseminated intravascular coagulation - Information on the latest anticoagulants and antithrombotics, including bleeding risks and strategies to control bleeding. Fast Facts: Bleeding Disorders remains a comprehensive up-to-date reference that reflects the latest research and clinical guidelines. It will assist primary care providers, physician assistants, nurse-clinicians, pharmacists, residents and doctors in training as they confront the challenges of controlling bleeding in patients with hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, platelet disorders and thrombosis, or as a result of antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy. It is a small book packed with important information, designed to swiftly improve patient treatment and outcomes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8aa6cfff467dc76226776885982d3cd766bda82","amp;dn":"Fast+Facts+Bleeding+Disorders+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8aa6cfff467dc76226776885982d3cd766bda82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,170,108,255,244,103,220,118,34,103,118,136,89,130,211,205,118,107,218,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
