John Corapi---A Lenten Retreat\n\n     Father John Corapi presents a Lenten retreat including four of his most moving presentations ever. This one of the most powerful retreats ever preached by Fr. Corapi, capturing the heart of redemption and God's ultimate Mercy.\n\nFr. John Corapi---Apocalypse Now-The Book of Revelations\n\n     The last book of the Bible, the Book of Revelation, or Apocalypse as it used to be called, speaks of a spiritual and definitive war between the forces of good and evil. Fr. Corapi teaches the essence of this message from the perspective of a priest with an ecclesiastical doctorate in dogmatic theology, as well as from his practical &quot;street sense&quot; of the everyday contemporary combat with the forces of evil that people today face. In a very real sense we don't have to wait for some future date centuries from now to experience the intensity of such a cataclysmic clash. The &quot;Apocalypse&quot; in a very real way is now!\n\nFr. John Corapi---Catechism Series (The Teachings of Jesus Christ)\n\n     Father John Corapi's greatest work of teaching and preaching is captured in this major series on the Catechism of the Catholic Church. To the best of our knowledge it is the only series of its kind in scope and depth. Consisting of 50 lectures, approximately one hour each, this series synthesizes the Catholic Church's official Catechism. &quot;A sure norm for teaching the faith,&quot; as Pope John Paul II calls it, the Catechism of the Catholic Church is the benchmark for all Catholic doctrinal and moral teaching. Broadcast and used in over 100 countries throughout the world, this series by Father Corapi has helped countless people to love and know the Catholic faith better.\n\nFr. John Corapi---Come Home! To the Catholic Church\n\n     A series of four lectures by Father John Corapi dealing with why Catholics leave their Church, why others criticize and attack the Catholic Church, and why you should come home to the Catholic Church. Based upon his own experience, with many examples from his life, as well as his education, Father Corapi sets forth in his clear and straight-forward style the basics surrounding this important discussion.\n\nFr. John Corapi---End Game\n\n     In the cosmic warfare known as human existence, the &quot;Adversary&quot;, Satan, attempts to neutralize the Church in order to destroy humanity and all of creation. In this important new series Father John Corapi presents his thesis on the Devil's final battle plan to cripple the Church in order to afflict, enslave and ultimately destroy mankind.\n\nFr. John Corapi---Fatima Today: Message of Life for a Dying World\n\n     Concerning the message of Fatima, then know as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Pope Benedict XVI's Prefect for the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, says: &quot;The Evil One has power in this world, as we see and experience continually; he has power because our freedom continually lets itself be led away from God. But since God himself took a human heart and has steered human freedom towards what is good, the freedom to choose evil no longer has the last word. From that time forth, the word that prevails is this: 'In the World you will have tribulation, but take heart; I have overcome the world' (John 16:33).&quot;\n\n     The message of Fatima invites us to trust in that promise. In this six-part series, Fatima Today; Message of Life for a Dying World, Father John Corapi outlines clearly and forcefully the essence and importance of Our Lady of Fatima's message to the world that is sick and close to death.\n\nFr. John Corapi---Immortal Combat\n\n     This series of eight spiritual conferences is by far one of the most popular of all of Father Corapi's hundreds of titles. In a world filled with conflict and strife we would do well to remember that &quot;Our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers...&quot; as St. Paul teaches us in Ephesians 6.\n\n     Fr. Corapi presents this series as a basic course in spiritual warfare. Topics such as the reality of spiritual combat, the sacraments and sacramentals as weapons in this combat, the angels and souls in purgatory as our allies, the Cross and humility as powerful weapons, and other topics are covered in this powerful series. A true Fr. Corapi classic!\n\nFr. John Corapi---Luminous Mysteries of the Rosary\n\n     For the first time in over 800 years there is a significant change in the Rosary. Pope John Paul II gives us the Luminous Mysteries of the Rosary. These are Gospel events from the public ministry of Jesus, allowing us to enter more deeply than ever into the mystery of Christ and His Mission. To pray the Rosary is to pray the Gospel. To pray the Gospel is to pray Jesus Christ. In this series Father covers Pope John Paul II's apostolic letter introducing the new Mysteries, and explains each of the five new Mysteries in detail. This is a powerful presentation on a powerful prayer.\n\nFr. John Corapi---New War Old War\n\n     This series was forged in the flames and fire of 911, but prepared for by Father's entire life. New War, Old War is the title sermon of this four-part series. It deals with the spiritual roots of the real war behind all war and strife. Drawing an analogy from military training Father speaks of spiritual training, spiritual weapons and tactics, and the key to being a good soldier or a good Christian: To serve, not to be served. &quot;Immorality is unAmerican and a threat to national security,&quot; has become a battle cry for many seeking to bring us back to the moral uprightness we once took pride in.\n\nFr. John Corapi---Other\n\n     Addictions - Fr. John Begins this talk with the Gospel of John. Jesus said,&quot;Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free&quot;...Free from compulsion, habit,vice, alcohol,drugs, gambling, television, pornography, computers, women, men, just about anything you can imagine. Father's life experiences qualify him to speak first hand on the enslavement of mankind... on power and the loss of power. As he discusses his own life journey he says, &quot;I have been to places you can't even fathom and seen things you don't even want to see.&quot; In this talk Father Corapi explores God and his creation, &quot;God creates every soul and it must be good because they come from God, which is goodness itself.&quot;\n     \n     Advent: Preparation for the Lord - Advent is a preparation for the coming of Christ. As Saint John the Baptist said, &quot;Make straight the paths of the Lord.&quot; Our prayer life, more than ever at this time of the year, prepares us for the coming of Jesus at Christmas.\n     \n     Contemporary Attacks on the Family - It should be no secret that the traditional family is the basic building block from which societies, good or bad, are built. When the traditional family unit (man-woman/husband-wife, children) is eroded away, distorted, divided, or otherwise assaulted, society begins to be eroded away, distorted, divided, and otherwise assaulted, leading to the ultimate demise of that society. Such is the case today.\n     \n     How to Make a Good Confession - Father Corapi speaks from both his knowledge of theology and his personal experience concerning the sacrament of reconciliation or confession. How to make a good confession is the first step to finding true peace and joy in life. Through an examination of conscience and a detailed look at the Ten Commandments, Father Corapi leads us to self-knowledge, confession of our sins, and the resultant peace and joy that is beyond all understanding.\n     \n     The Priest as Preacher - In this inspiring and educational talk, Father discusses the role of priest as the preacher. Father lays out key points every priest and seminarian should know about this important part of the vocation. This one hour sermon is essential for every priest, seminarian or future seminarian- as well as extremely informative for the Catholic lay people.\n     \n     The Abundant Life - Eyes to See and Ears to Hear: Reading and Heeding the Signs of the Times with Fr. John Corapi, SOLT - It is clear that our day and time is unprecedented in human history. Technology, communication capabilities, and neo-pagan and neo-atheistic ideologies have coalesced to not only threaten, but all but bury, the Judeo-Christian ethos in the marketplaces of ideas and public policy. TodayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s culture is a hostile environment for people of faith. Ridicule, mockery, and disdain have become the sentiments of the intellectual elite toward the Judeo-Christian fundamental values and those who hold to them. What is our response? What should it be? And, is it possible that each one of us has been born for a time such as this?\n\nFr. John Corapi---Surrender is NOT an Option\n\n     In this four part series Father John Corapi explores the reality of spiritual warfare and how it involves the family. Using Sacred Scripture and other official Church documents Father Corapi vigorously asserts that this war is real. To deny this fundamental fact is at once foolhardy and reckless.\n\n     Like any war this one has weapons, tactics, and strategy. A battle-plan is essential. The family is the basic unit in God's army, and is either battle-ready or it isn't. This is the real war to end all wars, the consequences of which are eternal. Most people today just ignore the battle or give up, surrendering their eternal future to chance or the Enemy himself. Surrender is not an option! Fight or die.\n\nFr. John Corapi---The Catholic Church\n\n     This series is a direct response to the terrible scandals that have rocked the Catholic Church in recent years. Touching on such essential themes as the Church as the Bride of Christ, Mary as Mother of the Church, and the Eucharist as the source, center, and summit of the Church's life, this series helps the faithful regain a more balanced and honest view of the Church in the light of Christ who is Head of His Church.\n\nFr. John Corapi---The Easter Triduum\n\n     Fr. John Corapi, S.O.L.T., delivers a 3-part series on the profound spiritual significance of the events of Holy Week, inspiring us to enter more deeply into this most solemn period of the Church's liturgical year. You will come to a fuller understanding of the focal point of our Faith - Christ's Passion, Death and Resurrection. 3 hrs.\n\nFr. John Corapi---The Moon Under Her Feet\n\n     In this four part series Father John Corapi goes to the heart of the contemporary world's many woes and wars, whether the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Somalia, or the Congo, or the natural disasters that seem to be increasing every year, the moral and spiritual war is at the basis of everything. &quot;Our battle is not against human forces,&quot; St. Paul asserts, &quot;but against principalities and powers, against the world rulers of this present darkness...&quot; Ephesians 6:12.\n\n     The &quot;War to end all wars&quot; is the moral and spiritual combat that rages in the hearts and minds of human beings. The outcome of that unseen fight largely determines how the battle in the realm of the seen unfolds.\n\n     The title talk, &quot;With the Moon Under Her Feet,&quot; is taken from the twelfth chapter of the Book of Revelation, and deals with the current threat to the world from radical Islam, and the Blessed Virgin Mary's role in the ultimate victory that will result in the conversion of Islam. Few Catholics are aware of the connection between Islam, Fatima, and Guadalupe. Presented in Father Corapi's straight-forward style, you will be both inspired and educated by this four part series on topics more timely than ever.\n\nFr. John Corapi---The Paschal Mystery\n\n     The Paschal Mystery is the 'redemptive death' and glorious Resurrection of Jesus Christ. We share in this whenever we participate in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and whenever we sincerely offer our sufferings - large or small - to God. We must acknowledge that only He can use those by uniting them to the redemptive suffering of Jesus and God's redeeming love.\n\nFr. John Corapi---The Power of the Eucharist\n\n     Pope John Paul II has solemnly declared that October, 2004 through October 2005 is &quot;The Year of the Eucharist.&quot; At a decisive time in history, this historic Pope has first declared &quot;The Year of the Rosary,&quot; followed by &quot;The Year of the Eucharist.&quot; It is our duty to respond by learning and loving everything about the holy Eucharist: the &quot;source, center, and summit of the Church's life.&quot;\n\n     At the request of the Holy Father, Father John Corapi preached this six part series based on the Pope's Apostolic Letter &quot;Mane nobiscum Domine&quot; (&quot;Stay With Us Lord&quot;). \n\n     The six sermons in the series are: 1.) Contemplating Jesus through Mary 2.) Eucharist: Mystery of Light 3.) The Real, True, and Substantial Presence 4.) Eucharist: Source and Manifestation of Unity 5.) Eucharist: Principal and Plan of Mission 6.) Priesthood/Eucharist = Sacrifice\n\nFr. John Corapi---The Power of the Rosary\n\n     Father John Corapi has preached on the power and efficacy of the holy Rosary from the day he was ordained. In this powerful sermon, Father teaches the Rosary is the &quot;prayer of the Gospel...the prayer of Jesus himself.&quot; Father explains the first fifteen Mysteries of the Rosary; the Joyful, Sorrowful and Glorious.\n\nFr. John Corapi---Word of God\n\n     In this 6-part series, Father Corapi presents the Catholic Church's approach to Divine Revelation. We have suffered a crisis of method in various academic disciplines in recent years. Divine Revelation actually consists of three parts, not just the one written form most people think of (the Bible or Sacred Scripture). Most have never been taught about the importance of Sacred Tradition and Magesterial teaching. Catholics are bound in conscience to read the Bible as the Church reads Sacred Scriptures, or run the risk of misinterpreting the inspired Word of God.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f64eb22999f196bd5b37e5e64d9a6359913df595","amp;dn":"Fr.+John+Corapi+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f64eb22999f196bd5b37e5e64d9a6359913df595","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,78,178,41,153,241,150,189,91,55,229,230,77,154,99,89,145,61,245,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
