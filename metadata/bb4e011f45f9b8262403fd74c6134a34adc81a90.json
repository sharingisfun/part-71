According to the original info file, the original uploader (apparently not on Dime, but elsewhere) was 'japrainbow' - many thanks to her or him as well! The show is well-known, but this bootleg IMHO beats any other version of this show that has been on Dime before (and possibly any other version in circulation). Two sources are available from this show: one was taped by Purplecockney AKA Steve M. and shared here a while ago; the other (better-sounding) source was released on the 'London Hammersmith Odeon' LP bootleg and also shared on Dime in several versions (including the 'Never a Maker' and 'Live Murder Act I' CD bootlegs, both of which are obviously sourced from the 'London Hammersmith Odeon' LP bootleg). 'Holy War', which I am uploading here, is from the same source as the 'London Hammersmith Odeon' LP bootleg and its CD reincarnations. 'Holy War' was released by Metal Sword Records in 2000, and the artwork claims that it is a 'digitally remastered edition' of an 'original master recording'. While I am generelly sceptical about claims written on the artwork of commercial bootlegs, I tend to believe that this is really sourced from a transfer of the master tape. Thus, the sound quality is even better than on the other available bootlegs (which are quite nice already), and I do not hear any vinyl cracks. Moreover, the sound is NOT overcompressed (as it is on some commercial CD bootlegs of other shows, especially those released by Tarantura - I am extremely happy that this bootleg is NOT from Tarantura!). A picture of the spectrum is included in this upload. More importantly, check out the samples below - I am curious for your opinions!\n\nOne thing, however, is strange about this bootleg: 'Paranoid' and 'Children of the Grave' are located on the end of disc 1 instead of the end of disc 2 where they would belong. My friend Phobos corrected this in the following way:\n- He moved the encore break noise from the end of 'Lady Evil' to the place between 'Die Young' and 'Paranoid' (where it belongs),\n- added a fade-out at the end of 'Lady Evil' (which is now the last track of disc 1)\n- and arranged for a smooth transition between 'Die Young', encore break and 'Paranoid'.\nMany thanks to Phobos for his work! Anyway, for those who prefer to have the tracks in the same order as they were released on CD, I have added the original files of 'Lady Evil', 'Die Young', 'Paranoid' and 'Children of the Grave' in a subfolder of this upload, called 'Original tracks'. \n\nTracklist (track order corrected):\n101 Supertzar (Intro Tape) (01:31)\n102 War Pigs (07:29)\n103 Neon Knights (04:59)\n104 N.I.B. + Drum Solo (05:33)\n105 Children Of The Sea (06:36)\n106 Sweet Leaf (08:06)\n107 Lady Evil (04:24)\n201 Black Sabbath (09:54)\n202 Heaven And Hell (11:23)\n203 Iron Man (07:21)\n204 Guitar Solo (12:53)\n205 Die Young (04:14)\n206 Paranoid (04:58)\n207 Children Of The Grave (05:46)\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nORIGINAL INFO:\n\n'Black Sabbath\nTitle: Holy War\nDates: 20th January, 1981\nVenue: Hammersmith Odeon, London, England.\n\nSource: Ex- Audence Recording\nLineage: 2000 Metal Sword Records MS CD 022/23 Boot 2CD-R &gt; WAV &gt; FLAC\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisc.1 \n01: Opening Se Supertzer\n02: War Pig\n03: Neon Knights\n04: N.I.B (incl.
