Each week, the crews are given a challenge. The challenge is different for each crew, but has the same general concept or shares a specific theme. To begin each episode, Mario Lopez reveals, in no particular order, which crews are safe and which crews are at risk for elimination. After the crews in the bottom perform their routines, the judges decide which crew will advance to the next round.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a373fa673e1182c1eac936d06012acea1bcd722","amp;dn":"America%27s+Best+Dance+Crew+-+Complete+Series+%28Corrected%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a373fa673e1182c1eac936d06012acea1bcd722","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,55,63,166,115,225,24,44,30,172,147,109,6,1,42,206,161,188,215,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
