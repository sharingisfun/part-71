The beast does not confine his violent assaults to fair nude females of the species! How will the camp survive?\n\nA host of New York City sexploitation starlets appear here in living color, and they get to recite and improvise their own dialogue! Did director Barry Mahon fly them to Florida for this epic production, or did he shoot their scenes (mostly interiors) in New York City as I suspect?\n\nBeautiful bodies, and performances that will linger in your imagination LONG after the movie ends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c46eb095b5a86eb3772981fd1d8d44c85ab83332","amp;dn":"The+Beast+That+Killed+Women","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c46eb095b5a86eb3772981fd1d8d44c85ab83332","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,110,176,149,181,168,110,179,119,41,129,253,29,141,68,200,90,184,51,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
