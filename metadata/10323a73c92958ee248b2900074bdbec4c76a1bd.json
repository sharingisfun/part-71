The film tells the story of ten people who are drawn to stay in an old hotel in a remote Welsh village.\n\nA group of travellers, each with a personal problem that they want to hide, arrive at a mysterious Welsh country inn. There is a certain strangeness in the air as they are greeted by the innkeeper and his daughter (Mervyn Johns and his real life daughter Glynis Johns). Why are all the newspapers a year old? And why doesn't Gwyneth seem to cast a shadow?
