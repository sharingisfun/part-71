Muso provides an alternative front end to your music player and allows you to experience a more meaningful interaction with your music collection.\n\nWhat muso isn't\nMuso is not a music player or playlist manager. There are many of these available already, with great features like wireless streaming to your hi-fi, bit-perfect output, graphic equalisers, stunning visualisers, smart playlists, and a myriad of plugins. Muso is not trying to compete with these, but muso can be used to queue music to your favourite player. Currently we are supporting the following players:\n\nLogitech Squeezebox devices - this is muso's preferred solution for streaming music to your hi-fi.\nWinamp - Winamp is muso's preferred solution when you want to play your music directly on your PC.\niTunes - iTunes will continue to be your music player but muso will take over as a browser and as your music database. You can import your existing database from iTunes as a starting point for muso.\nFoobar2000 - beta test functionality only (eg. no feedback of Now Playing status information).\nWe may add other players in future (additional players which expose an open API could be added to this list).\n\nSupported OS:\n\nWindows All\nNote that this software requires .NET framework 3.5 (SP1) as a prerequisite.\n\nHomepage: http://klarita.net/muso.html\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program.\n- Use keygen to get personalized serial.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcfddfb6a3f37538820b990ca781ccbbf89f056d","amp;dn":"muso+v2.0.17.1+Incl+Keygen-BEAN+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcfddfb6a3f37538820b990ca781ccbbf89f056d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,253,223,182,163,243,117,56,130,11,153,12,167,129,204,187,248,159,5,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
