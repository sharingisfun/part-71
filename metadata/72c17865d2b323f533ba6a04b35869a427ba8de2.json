GLORY!, follows a television evangelist show from its roots in a small country church to its complete and total sell-out to commercialism. The Reverend Dan Stuckey (Barry Morse) slowly and painstakingly builds a TV ministry in a tiny country church, taking in half a million dollars a day. His accountant, Reverend Lester Babbitt, (James Whitmore) was given Divine guidance on how to evade taxes on the Church's investments. After his death, Reverend Bobby Joe (Richard Thomas) tries to assume his father's role. However, his boring philosophical sermons fail to bring in enough money to keep the Church afloat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72c17865d2b323f533ba6a04b35869a427ba8de2","amp;dn":"glory+glory+%281989%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72c17865d2b323f533ba6a04b35869a427ba8de2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,193,120,101,210,179,35,245,51,186,106,4,179,88,105,164,39,186,141,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
