Tracks like &quot;The Fairground&quot; and &quot;Mindstorm&quot; display Sureshot's intense production style; basslines are time-stretched to the breaking point while an assortment of nervous-breakdown synth adds to the general air of menace. Palmer is equally adept at expanding on the darkness with several string tracks, including a gorgeous song called &quot;The Journey.&quot; (4/5)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:977d7bba25379f3c1af5e6cdbb6c610f5c734829","amp;dn":"Sureshot+-+Underground+Symphony+%5B1996%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"977d7bba25379f3c1af5e6cdbb6c610f5c734829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,125,123,186,37,55,159,60,26,245,230,205,187,108,97,15,92,115,72,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
