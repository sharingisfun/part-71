Caught between her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old-world traditions and the demands of a modern career, she cannot seem to find her place.\n\nOnly her beloved grandmother on Erikousa, a magical island off the coast of Greece, knows her heart. DaphneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fondest memories are of times spent in the kitchen with Yia-yia, cooking and learning about the ancient myths. It was the thought of Yia-yia that consoled Daphne in the wake of her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unexpected death.\n\nAfter years of struggling to raise her child and pay the bills, Daphne now has a successful restaurant, a growing reputation as a chef, and a wealthy fiancÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â€everything sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever wanted. But across the ocean, Yia-yia can see through the storybook perfection of DaphneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€ and now she is calling her back to Erikousa. She has secrets about the past to share with her granddaughterÃ¢â‚¬â€ stories from the war, of loyalty and bravery in the face of death. She also has one last lesson to teach her: that security is not love, and that her life can be filled with meaning again. \n\n**\n\nFrom Booklist\n\nAfter the heartbreak of losing her first husband, Daphne is ready to marry practical Stephen. But she cannot move forward without looking back, and she feels compelled to move the wedding to tiny Erikousa, Greece, where Daphne spent every childhood summer with her beloved Yia Yia. As Daphne regains the inner peace she felt swimming in the Ionian Sea and eating Yia YiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s traditional food, her shy five-year-old daughter, Evie, opens up and thrives among the boisterous neighbors and feral cats. The one dark spot is the fisherman, Yianni, who is cold to Daphne (and vice versa) but dedicated to Yia Yia. Daphne learns the history of the deep connection between the surly fisherman and her grandmother. She also learns to open herself up to the voices of the cypress trees. Though DaphneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey is the emotional center of the book, the real star is the island of Erikousa, from the sun-baked patios to the spitting widows who meet every ferry. There is just enough humor to balance the heartache, and a dash of history adds depth. Readers will be transported. --Susan Maguire\n\nReview\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“When the Cypress Whispersis a rich, emotionally-nuanced story about a womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deeply held connection to her family and her past.
