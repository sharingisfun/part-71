We highly suggest that you don't download this since the source was\nrough, don't say we haven't told you so. First CAM, 3D video, has movement and the odd line of hardcoded subs\nWe cropped it so that there are no hardcoded subtitles for a large portion of the movie, they do come back slightly\nat crooked angles from time to time due to camera movement though. We placed a smooth blur over the watermark at\nthe top right of the video and that's hardly noticeable now unless you go looking for it. Other than that we just\nfiltered it, added some colour, resized and then boom. Starts off very shaky. This is a cross between the Godzilla\nsource and the Spiderman 3D source that went around, you'll get what we mean if you grab this. All in all a\nwatchable first CAM if you're desperate, we doubt it'll get much better from this source\n\nP.S - Hit us up with all of your ungrateful hate comments, seriously, there's nothing more we enjoy doing than reading\nyour comments and knowing that we wasted your ungrateful asses time. Check the sample since the screenshots always look\nbetter, if you don't like the look of it then please just move along. If you think you can do better then go fuck off\nand prove it. Peace\n\nGreetz: bustheadz, DiNGiE, MiLLENiUM, EVE, SmY, CRYPTO, CLUEL3SS, FooKaS, KingStoner, SiNDK8, FiNGERBLaST, FUN\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b33eb24faad19b20f47e190ba6549dfc7398169","amp;dn":"X-Men+Days+Of+Future+Past+2014+READNFO+CAM+XviD-HELLRAZ0R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b33eb24faad19b20f47e190ba6549dfc7398169","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,51,235,36,250,173,25,178,15,71,225,144,186,101,73,223,199,57,129,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
