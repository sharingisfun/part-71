Join Jeeves &amp; Wooster for an enchanting romp through the drawing rooms and diversions of Britain's tweedy elite. Bertie Wooster is the classic young British man of means, blessed with a touch too generous a heart and a slight deficit in the noggin' department. Jeeves is his hilariously arch and resourceful valet, a &quot;Gentleman's Gentleman&quot; without equal who sees Bertie through the never-ending swirl of hopeless old friends, indomitable aunts, unbidden guests, and romantic entanglements that dominate his life. Jeeves &amp; Wooster The Complete Series includes all 23 episodes (1990-3) of the acclaimed series based on P. G. Wodehouse's beloved stories. Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie are spot-on as the unflappable butler and his overwrought employer, and their inimitable misadventures are masterfully adapted for the screen by Clive Exton. Bonus features include a P.G. Wodehouse biography and filmography.\n\nProduct Details\nRelease Date: 5/26/2009\nUPC: 733961158724\nRating: \nSource: A&amp;E Home Video\nPresentation: Slimline edition\nSound: Dolby Digital Stereo\nLanguage: English\nTime: 19:10:00\nFormat: DVD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:929eec1c19251b6480d4219b3832522e55a135c9","amp;dn":"Jeeves+and+Wooster+Complete+-+NTSC+Vob+Files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"929eec1c19251b6480d4219b3832522e55a135c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,158,236,28,25,37,27,100,128,212,33,155,56,50,82,46,85,161,53,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
