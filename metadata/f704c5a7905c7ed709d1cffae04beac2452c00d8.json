It also speculates on humanity's future evolutionary path.\nHomo Futurus is a controversial because it presents a theory regarding the mechanism driving the evolution of humans from primates to modern man that is distinctly non-Darwinian.\nThe theory being proposed challenges the presently accepted evolutionary premise that genetic mutations and environmental pressures are the prime influences for natural selection. It also speculates on humanity's long term future evolutionary path.
