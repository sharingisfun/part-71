With hardly any notice, Taylor Gang leader Wiz Khalifa has decided to drop a new mixtape full of bangers just in time for your drive to work in the morning (don't you just love when good news comes at the end of the weekend?). \n\nFeaturing uncredited guest appearances from the likes of Juicy J and Pimp C (&quot;Word on the Town&quot;), 28 Grams serves as an appetizer for the rapper's upcoming Blacc Hollywood album, which is expected to arrive in stores sometime before Dr. Dre's Detox album. Guest features from Adele and Miley Cyrus were initially reported but have now been denied from Wiz. The rapper still stands by his statements that the album will be his best yet.\n\nWhat do you think of the mixtape? Is Wiz back in top form?\n\nTracklist\n1. Aw Shit (Prod. Sledgren / RMBJustize)\n2.
