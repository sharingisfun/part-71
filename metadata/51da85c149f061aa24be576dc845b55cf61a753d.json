If you can survive fiery trench runs, flail-swinging gladiators in intergalactic arenas, and feuding trash moguls, you'll discover that you're a Sage, capable of rewriting the physical laws with your thoughts.\n\nExploring the quantum space beneath atoms has made most Sages rather... eccentric, but relatively harmless.
