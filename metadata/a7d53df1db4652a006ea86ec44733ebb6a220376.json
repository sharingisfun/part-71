You will hear lawyers and their sometimes heated exchanges with the justices. You'll hear Thurgood Marshall in the Little Rock school integration case and other lawyers from famous cases such as Roe v. Wade. For more than two centuries, the Supreme Court has exerted extraordinary influence over the way we Americans live our daily lives. The Court has defined the limits of our speech and actions since its first meeting in 1790, adding to our history books names such as John Marshall, Louis Brandeis, Hugo Black, Earl Warren, Thurgood Marshall, Warren Burger, William Rehnquist, and many others. The History of the Supreme Court traces the development of the Court from a body having little power or prestige to its current status as &quot;the most powerful and prestigious judicial institution in the world.&quot; The course is taught by a professor schooled in law and politics-both of which are critical to understanding the Court-who is an honored teacher as well as an experienced advocate. Wide-ranging in scope, and clear and nuanced in its presentation, The History of the Supreme Court offers a fascinating look into a vital institution.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7d53df1db4652a006ea86ec44733ebb6a220376","amp;dn":"TTC+-+History+of+the+Supreme+Court+%28Audio%29%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7d53df1db4652a006ea86ec44733ebb6a220376","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,213,61,241,219,70,82,160,6,234,134,236,68,115,62,187,106,34,3,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
