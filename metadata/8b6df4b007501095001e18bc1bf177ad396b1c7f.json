It pulses with the energy of the debut, the lush flow of the second, and the conceptual theme of Snivilisation. The focus this time, though, is ecology. &quot;The Girl With the Sun in Her Head&quot; was recorded on a Greenpeace bus using only solar power, and &quot;Dwr Budr&quot; (Welsh for &quot;dirty water&quot;) also criticizes the misuse of natural resources. Phil and Paul's respect for the jungle/drum'n'bass movement showed in the moderate breakbeat rhythms on several tracks.
