Originally released on Rex in 1991, Delusions of Grandeur was reissued on Universal five years later and made the group the first ever artist to be signed to the newly merged Universal Records.\nDelusions of Grandeur is spunky, layered with rollicking wit and sophisticated sassiness. They're too sweet to be indie and too original to be mainstream, therefore Fleming &amp; John are individualists when it comes to composing their quirky, melodic sound. Songs like &quot;I'm Not Afraid&quot; and &quot;Love Songs&quot; are sweetly tainted with vivacious guitar licks and Fleming's squalling vocals. And when it comes to songwriting, Fleming &amp; John refrain from typical grunge-rock riffs for more structured harmonies and crashing hooks. They are swirly and poetic when addressing love and everything that comes along with it. &quot;Rain All Day&quot; is the album's swooning pop anthem, and lyrically Fleming &amp; John are emotionally and artistically endless. It's too sweet to figure out, yet too complex to want to decipher.
