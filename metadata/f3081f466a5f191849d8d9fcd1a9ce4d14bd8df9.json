Shoulder buttons can also be used to change between foreground and background and can be used to activate the character's special attack.\n\nAn unusual aspect of the game is that if the player stands still during an attack, it is considered a guard. Other features include a combo counter and a guided elemental attack which launches an enemy.\n\nThere are a total of 12 characters including the 4 story characters and the 8 unlockable bosses.\n\nThere are 8 stages to complete in total.\n\nDeveloper(s) \tFill-in-Cafe\nPublisher(s) \tBanpresto\nPlatform(s) \tPlayStation, PlayStation Network\nRelease date(s) \tPlayStation\n\n    JP August 7, 1997\n\nPlayStation Network\n\n    JP July 6, 2011\n\nMode(s) \tSingle-player\nDistribution \t1 CD-ROM\n\n------------------------------------------------\nUse alcohol 120%, img burn or nero software to burn it to CDR.\nVery good game never release outside Japan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3081f466a5f191849d8d9fcd1a9ce4d14bd8df9","amp;dn":"Panzer+Bandit+-+PSone+%28PSX%29+NTSC-J+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3081f466a5f191849d8d9fcd1a9ce4d14bd8df9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,8,31,70,106,95,25,24,73,216,217,252,209,169,206,77,20,189,141,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
