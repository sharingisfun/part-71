The objects illustrate an extensive period in the early history of many peoples, both settled and nomadic, which once inhabited the territory now belonging to the Soviet Union.\nA brief survey of the history of the Hermitage collection, with special reference to the complexes from which the materials published are derived, is given in the  introduction.\nThe Notes contain the usual data (material, size etc.), accompanied by scholarly comment. Beautiful examples of man's creative activity, from the earliest productions of the Stone Age to masterly works by mediaeval craftsmen, have been chosen to give the reader an idea of the gradual development of aesthetic feeling in our ancestors, and the evolution of the content and form of their art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:857cb733a22f0431ab23381f5106425b9845ab18","amp;dn":"The+Dawn+of+Art+-+Palaeolithic%2C+Neolithic%2C+Bronze+and+Iron+Age+r","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"857cb733a22f0431ab23381f5106425b9845ab18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,124,183,51,162,47,4,49,171,35,56,31,81,6,66,91,152,69,171,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
