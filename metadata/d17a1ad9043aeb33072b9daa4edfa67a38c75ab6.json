The first episode was such an accurate parody of a bad phone-in show that many listeners were fooled into believing it was genuine, and thus complained to the BBC (see the press clippings section of this guide for more on this).\n\n The BBC helped create this subterfuge by publishing a fake profile for Gary Bellamy on the Radio 4 website; setting up a phone number for the show (with a message saying that the line was busy); and dropping the credits to hide the fact the callers were actually actors.\n\n It wasn't until almost a week later that the people behind the show were un-veiled as well known comedy actors\n Since then, the buzz around the show has died down, but the programme continues on with a loyal fan base.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/down_the_line/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/down_the_line/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n Cast:\n Rhys Thomas\n Paul Whitehouse\n Charlie Higson,\n Simon Day\n Lucy Montgomery\n Amelia Bullmore\n Matt Lucas\n Felix Dexter\n Mark Gatiss\n Catherine Tate\n Arabella Weir\n\n \n  \n=================== What's In This Torrent =================== \n\nDown The Line - S01 (6x30 Minutes)\n\nDown The Line - S02 (7x30 Minutes)(Includes 1 Special)\n\nDown The Line - S03 (7x30 Minutes)(Includes 1 Special)\n\nDown The Line - S04 (7x30 Minutes)\n \nDown The Line - S05 (5x30 Minutes)(Includes 1 Special) \n \n \n \n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Down The Line.mp3\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFile size                   : 25.4 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 27mn 45s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Constant\nTotal bitrate               : 128 Kbps\nAlbum                       : Down The Line - S01 to 05\nAlbum/Performer             : Rhys Thomas\nGenre                       : Comedy\nRecorded_Date               : 2006 to 2013\nComment                     : MP3's Recorded By Slimoo\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nDuration (ms)               : 27mn 49s\nBitrate mode                : Constant\nBitrate                     : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 44.1 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 25.4 MB (100%)\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d17a1ad9043aeb33072b9daa4edfa67a38c75ab6","amp;dn":"Down+The+Line+-+S01+to+05+-+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d17a1ad9043aeb33072b9daa4edfa67a38c75ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,122,26,217,4,58,235,51,7,43,157,170,78,223,166,122,56,199,90,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
