Basically, it is a catalog of &quot;pretty much&quot; every Phish show in circulation from before 10/07/2000 (Phish ended their first hiatus on 12/31/2002, and henceforth all recordings have been available via LivePhish).  Some are SBD, but by far mostly AUD; all have recording info; all are tagged, and even have artwork which corresponds to the ticket stub or venue; NONE of this is in FLAC:  This is exactly how this torrent was seeded about 5 years ago.  Some are 320, but most are lower bitrates.  However, the point is that many - if not most - of these recordings are not available at bt.etree.org...but if they are, I heartily suggest you head over there and download that and any other shows you like in wonderful FLAC.  If I find that any of these shows are available via bt.etree.org in FLAC I will upload that as well.  I am offering this collection up because it is comprehensive:  it really does comprise almost every Phish show in circulation from before the first hiatus.  I am really anal about FLAC/320 just like most of you, but the vast majority of these shows offered here are not presently available in the bittorrent community in any other format (although, once again, some are available at bt.etree.org, and some though Phish.com).\n\nThis is the fifth of roughly 50 torrents which comprise the whole collection, which goes from 1984 - 2000.  \n\nHere are the shows included in this installment, 1993 part 05:\n\n1993-05-01 Tower Theatre, Philadelphia PA (SBD Soundcheck)\n1993-05-01 Tower Theatre, Philadelphia PA (SBD)\n1993-05-02 Tower Theatre, Philadelphia PA (SBD)\n1993-05-03 State Theatre, New Brunswick NJ (MTX)\n1993-05-05 Palace Theatre, Albany NY (SBD)\n1993-05-06 Palace Theatre, Albany NY (SBD)\n1993-05-07 Bangor Auditorium, Bangor ME (AUD)\n1993-05-08 Field House, University of New Hampshire, Durham NH (AR)\n1993-05-15 Fishman's Geodome, Underhill VT (AUD)\n1993-05-29 Laguna Seca Raceway, Monterey CA (AUD)\n1993-05-30 Laguna Seca Raceway, Monterey CA (AUD)\n1993-07-01 National Guitar Summit Workshop, Milford CT (AUD)\n1993-07-05 National Guitar Summit Workshop, Milford CT (AUD)\n1993-07-15 Cayuga County Fairgrounds, Weedsport NY (AUD Soundcheck)\n1993-07-15 Cayuga County Fairgrounds, Weedsport NY (AUD)\n1993-07-16 The Mann Center for the Performing Arts, Philadelphia PA (MTX)\n1993-07-17 The Filene Center at Wolf Trap, Vienna VA (AUD)\n1993-07-18 IC Light Amphitheater, Pittsburgh PA (AUD)\n1993-07-21 Orange County Fairgrounds, Middletown NY (AUD)\n1993-07-22 Stowe Performing Arts Center, Stowe VT (AUD)\n1993-07-23 Jones Beach Amphitheater, Wantagh NY (SBD)\n1993-07-24 Great Woods Center for the Performing Arts, Mansfield MA (AUD)\n1993-07-25 Waterloo Village, Stanhope NJ (SBD)\n1993-07-27 Classic Amphitheater, Richmond VA (AUD)\n1993-07-28 Grady Cole Center, Charlotte NC (AUD)\n1993-07-29 Tennessee Theatre, Knoxville TN (AUD)\n1993-07-30 The Veranda at Starwood, Antioch TN (AUD)\n1993-07-31 Masquerade Music Park, Atlanta GA (AUD)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da00a4954e566eba82cec5c3afc9ad7165f50abe","amp;dn":"Phish+-+PMCLP+1993+Part+5+%28Pretty+Much+Complete+Live+Phish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da00a4954e566eba82cec5c3afc9ad7165f50abe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,0,164,149,78,86,110,186,130,206,197,195,175,201,173,113,101,245,10,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
