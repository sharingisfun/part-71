The session has an informal, relaxed quality, and this approach serves a 48-year-old Hopkins impressively well on both originals like &quot;Thinkin' 'Bout an Old Friend&quot; and the familiar &quot;Katie Mae&quot; and enjoyable interpretations of Sonny Terry &amp; Brownie McGhee's &quot;Back to New Orleans&quot; and Arthur &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup's &quot;Mean Old Frisco.&quot; Hopkins' only accompaniment consists of bassist Leonard Gaskin and drummer Belton Evans, both of whom play in an understated fashion and do their part to make this intimate setting successful. From the remorseful &quot;Come Back Baby&quot; to more lighthearted, fun numbers like &quot;You Better Watch Yourself&quot; and &quot;Automobile Blues,&quot; Lightnin' is a lot like being in a small club with Hopkins as he shares his experiences, insights and humor with you.\n\n\nTracks:\n1.
