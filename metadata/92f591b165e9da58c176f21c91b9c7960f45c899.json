When a journalist researching the case is murdered 20 years later, the horror is reawakened. Now a New Age healing center, 16th-century Potwoolstan Hall is reputed to be cursed because of the crimes of its builder, and it seems the inheritance of evil lives. As more people die violently, detective Wesley Peterson must discover why a young woman has transformed a dollÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house into a miniature reconstruction of the massacre scene. The solution seems to lie in the ruined remains of an early English settlement in Virginia, but when the truth is finally revealed, it turns out to be as horrifying as it is dangerous.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92f591b165e9da58c176f21c91b9c7960f45c899","amp;dn":"Westly+Peterson-A+Cursed+Inheritance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92f591b165e9da58c176f21c91b9c7960f45c899","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,245,145,177,101,233,218,88,193,118,242,28,145,185,199,150,15,69,200,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
