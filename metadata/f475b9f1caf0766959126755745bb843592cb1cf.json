(He is the titular King.)\n\nKing of the Flies is designed as a trilogy of albums, which will combine to form a single graphic novel of stunning intricacy and intensity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f475b9f1caf0766959126755745bb843592cb1cf","amp;dn":"King+of+the+Flies+Book+1+Hallorave+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f475b9f1caf0766959126755745bb843592cb1cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,117,185,241,202,240,118,105,89,18,103,85,116,91,184,67,89,44,177,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
