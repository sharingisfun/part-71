Her loyalties are divided--perhaps she loves them both. The detective helps her to release her inner beauty and become a star overnight. And the rich man is the benefactor of a play she stars in. But something is very wrong. Money can be an evil guest, but there are other evils. As Lovecraft said, &quot;That is not dead which can eternal lie.&quot;\n\nThis is a stand-alone supernatural horror novel with a 30s noir atmosphere. Gene Wolfe can write in whatever genre he wants -- and always with superb style and profound depth. Now following his World Fantasy Award winner, Soldier of Sidon, and his stunning Pirate Freedom, Wolfe turns to the tradition of H.P. Lovecraft and the weird science tale of supernatural horror.\n\n&quot;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a pulp thriller Ã¢â‚¬â€ and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a compliment, because Wolfe knows from pulp thrillers and because here heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creating a strange sort of genre meltdown, a 21st century pulp adventure thriller with SF and horror elements that nobody else could possibly have written.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Neil Gaiman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2b6a85dcf9be2ced1664160e6cbf8a2784f12cf","amp;dn":"An+Evil+Guest+by+Gene+Wolfe.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2b6a85dcf9be2ced1664160e6cbf8a2784f12cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,182,168,93,207,155,226,206,209,102,65,96,230,203,248,162,120,79,18,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
