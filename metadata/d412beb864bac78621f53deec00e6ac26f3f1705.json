To be more exact it is a story of an elderly couple who take a look back in their life.\n\nThis is a five book series originally published independently in Finnish by Tommi Musturi. To date I believe only the first three have been published in English and I only have the first two ready to share at the moment.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/tommi-musturis-last-book-of-hope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/tommi-musturis-last-book-of-hope&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d412beb864bac78621f53deec00e6ac26f3f1705","amp;dn":"Tommi+Musturi+The+Second+Book+of+Hope+Restored","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d412beb864bac78621f53deec00e6ac26f3f1705","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,18,190,184,100,186,199,134,33,245,61,238,192,14,106,194,111,63,23,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
