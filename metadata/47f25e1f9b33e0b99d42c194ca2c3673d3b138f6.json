A one-stop-shop of thundering orchestral delightsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.\n\nALBION ORCHESTRA - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦if you need a palette of powerful orchestral ensembles which will inspire your writing, galvanise your scores and generally add class, sheen, size, power and depth to your orchestral armoury, the library delivers in spades.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sound On Sound Magazine October 2011.\n\nThe finest orchestral session musicians playing the finest, rarest instruments, recorded at Air Studios - Lyndhurst Hall, London, through the finest vintage, valve, and ribbon mics to 2&quot; tape. The only tape based orchestral library in the world. This is all you need to write epic sounding, widescreen cinematic orchestral music straight out of the box. Recorded in sections, this library features rich, aggressive and lyrical strings; punchy, growling brass; and some seriously malevolent woodwinds.\n\nAll patches come with 4 mixable/ routable and selectable mic positions C(lose), T(ree), A(mbient) and O(outrigger). Work with one mic &quot;in&quot; on your laptop on the plane, then render down with all four routed to 5.1 on your &quot;big rig&quot; back at your studio.\n\nIn addition to that, true legato is available across all choirs of the orchestra. A new and innovative addition is our &quot;Ostinatum&quot; engine that helps you build exciting and unexpected arrangements to your flowing top-lines and a huge bank of mod wheel fade orchestral FX to provide you with some alearic colours.\n\n\nKONTAKT 5.3 and above\n\n\nSEED IF U ARE DONE DOWNLOADING.
