Haven't we yet seen all of that? The short answer is: no. The cover of this release is a colourful one. It looks nice. Putting the DVD in to the player and up comes the first images and music ... Looking at the artwork and the beginning of the DVD your hopes might drop that this is a highly entertaining release. Don't let this fool you. When you are past the menu and the intro of the DVD you will be enlightened to see a truckload of footage. And very good ones ... Elvis going in to the Army was no doubt one of the most important news items in 1958 and the press came on to the story in full force. And therefore a lot of footage exists on the years 1958-1960.\n- See more at: http://www.elvis.com.a","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2d43ecb985246a21ea1ee7bf709c86d032399cc","amp;dn":"Elvis+Military+Tour+Of+Duty-1958-1960","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2d43ecb985246a21ea1ee7bf709c86d032399cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,212,62,203,152,82,70,162,30,161,238,123,247,9,200,109,3,35,153,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
