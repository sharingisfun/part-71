It contains all of the background music and sound effects used in the games, all of which were composed solely by Junichi Masuda, who is credited in the soundtrack. This includes PokÃƒÂ©mon cries and PokÃƒÂ©dex entries read by &quot;Dexter&quot;, Ash's PokÃƒÂ©dex, being the only soundtrack ever released to contain these sounds. The CD came with a map and stickers listing the 151 PokÃƒÂ©mon at the time.\n\nThis is the only core series game soundtrack so far to not be announced for an international release.\n\nTracks 1-45 of disc 1 contain the background music used in the games. Tracks 46-98 of disc 1 and tracks 1-98 of disc 2 are &quot;Dexter&quot;'s enunciation of the PokÃƒÂ©dex entries for each one of the 151 PokÃƒÂ©mon from Generation I, with the voice being from Shin'ichirÃ…ï¿½ Miki. Track 99 of disc 2 plays a techno-style instrumental music; when it's over, the sound effects used in-game are played.\n\nOnly Japanese titles are available as it was released exclusively in Japan. The English titles are unofficial translations adapted from the official English titles of PokÃƒÂ©mon FireRed &amp; PokÃƒÂ©mon LeafGreen: Super Music Collection.\n\nMore information: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Boy:_Entire_Pok%C3%A9mon_Sounds_Collection_CD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af60dd67aef4ef5b22ad8f0f5066fbcba685a7c2","amp;dn":"Game+Boy+Entire+Pokemon+Sounds+Collection+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af60dd67aef4ef5b22ad8f0f5066fbcba685a7c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,96,221,103,174,244,239,91,34,173,143,15,80,102,251,203,166,133,167,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
