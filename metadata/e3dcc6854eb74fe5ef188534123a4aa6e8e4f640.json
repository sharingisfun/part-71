This whole atmosphere is invigorated by the brutal vocals and screams, which from times to times are escorted or replaced by harsh-cleans, especially during the chorus parts. The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music features something more than a specific category of metal, with influences that ranges from artists such as Machine Head, In Flames to Lamb of God, Black Dahlia Murder.\n\nIn summer 2013, B.O. entered the studio in order to record their first EP. At late 2014, this 4-track promo CD was self-released under the name Ã¢â‚¬Å“BIONIC STATEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ getting a really positive feedback from people out there.\nThe band has already started working on their first FULL-LENGTH album while are planning as many live shows as possible to spread its name and music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3dcc6854eb74fe5ef188534123a4aa6e8e4f640","amp;dn":"Bionic+Origin+-+Bionic+State+EP+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3dcc6854eb74fe5ef188534123a4aa6e8e4f640","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,220,198,133,78,183,79,229,239,24,133,52,18,58,74,166,232,228,246,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
