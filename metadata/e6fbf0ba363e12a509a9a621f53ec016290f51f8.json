All My Friends showcases this show in double-CD/single-DVD and, in light of the subsequent announcement that the Allman Brothers Band would retire at the end of 2014 in the wake of the twin departures of Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks, it gains a certain sense of poignancy. Truthfully, it's hard not to envision this 26-song concert as the inaugural event in a year designed to showcase precisely how rich the legacy of the Allmans and Gregg in particular is. To that end, All My Friends is a rousing success.\n\nThe overall effect of All My Friends is dazzling; it illustrates just how rich Gregg Allman's contribution to American music is and what we'll miss when he retires.\n\n\n=== Disc: 1 ===\n\n 1.
