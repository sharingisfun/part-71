They are basically a Dungeons &amp; Dragons fan fiction, following Oloorin and his friends as they wander the lands in search of adventure, treasure and fame.\n\nBeing the author of the books, I chose to upload these here in hopes of reaching a wider audience. This series is the first series I have written, I myself see it as no masterpiece but acceptable enough for the first few books I have written. They are not the first ever book I have written, but the first ever books I have published (via Amazon kindle publishing). The important thing is that I tried to write as good as I could, \n\nAny feedback regarding the books would be greatly appreciated, both in the form of comments and reviews on amazon, goodreads or any other similar site. still just having my books read, makes it feel worth the effort of writing them.\n\nMay the Emprah be with you\nMikael B Lind ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33951b383baa09466a84612f7cf65589c01ce7cc","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Oloorin+and+Co","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33951b383baa09466a84612f7cf65589c01ce7cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,149,27,56,59,170,9,70,106,132,97,47,124,246,85,137,192,28,231,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
