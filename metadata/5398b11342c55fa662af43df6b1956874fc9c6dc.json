Infowars reporter and veteran SSG Joe Biggs was kicked out of the VA center in Austin, Texas after he tried to interview veterans about their medical care and he reports on both this incident and the scandal at large. \n\nAlso, in a series of encore interviews, Alex talks to school shooting expert and former state trooper Wolfgang Halbig as well as Dr. Alveda King, the niece of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and technology expert and author Dr. Nick Begich.\nWolfgang Halbig - May 13\nNick Begich - May 16\nAlveda King - May 19\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
