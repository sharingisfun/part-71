These sermons came from Marshill Church. \nI did my best to download all of these free sermons before they were all deleted from the internet. I cannot guarantee that every single sermon is here, but to my knowledge these are all of the older sermons that were taken off the web.\nI have not edited any content. I hope Mark's sermons help you get to know Jesus. \n\nThis is a b1 archive file. The files are not compressed so the quality will not suffer. Just download the free b1 archiver from b1.org to unzip the sermons. The download is a whopping 31.4 gb\nPlease Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3b1e86526af615189c07d835fb36f37b575037c","amp;dn":"Marshill+Sermon+Archive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3b1e86526af615189c07d835fb36f37b575037c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,177,232,101,38,175,97,81,137,192,125,131,95,179,111,55,181,117,3,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
