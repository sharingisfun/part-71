After a failed audition, where she is recognized as a burlesque performer from the Gayety Theatre, her manager \n\nand fiancÃƒÂ© Mike Hannegan suggest she writes an autobiography to project a more literate image and he hires Frederick Manly Gerard as a ghost writer. Doll Face agrees on the condition she is allowed to dedicate the book to Mike with &quot;For the love of Mike&quot;.\n\nAnother performer in the burlesque show, Chita Chula, remarks that if the book is a success and Doll Face leaves the show it will probably have to close down. Mike then decides to produce a Broadway show of his own with the financial aid of the performers themselves. Frederick offers to put up any money missing. Chita Chula (portrayed by Carmen Miranda) is sceptical she can pull it off, but Mike assures her she'll &quot;probably wound up being another Carmen Miranda!&quot;, something Chita Chula perceives as an insult.\n\nMike leaks word on the book to the press and, riding the publicity, argues the show got all the press it needs and that the book, although all but finished, needs not to be published. Doll Face, however, decides to go through with it and goes to Jamaica with Frederick for some final touch-ups. Boat engine trouble leaves them marooned on an island and when Mike finds them he breaks up with her. Without &quot;Doll Face&quot; as headliner, the Gayety Theatre struggles and Mike finally shuts it down.\n\nDoll Face releases her book &quot;The Genius DeMilo&quot; and when Mike sees she dedicated the book to Frederick instead of him, he regrets leaving her. After Doll Face refuses to talk to Mike he sends a lawyer to stop her show in the middle of opening night since she is under contract not to appear in any show not produced by him. She agrees to meet him and he asks her forgiveness. They reunite, she tricks the producer of her show to give Mike a 25% share and co-producer credit so the show can go on.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4999 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 80 mins\nSubtitles: Francais, Espanol\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 80 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d4f15b1d5ee0a657253813d435f6ba5813f6bce","amp;dn":"Doll+Face+%281945%29+DVD5+-+Vivian+Blaine+-+Perry+Como+Musical+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d4f15b1d5ee0a657253813d435f6ba5813f6bce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,79,21,177,213,238,10,101,114,83,129,61,67,95,107,165,129,63,107,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
