The English subtitles are now in the mkv and also in the torrent if you want to just put the .ass in something you have downloaded. Aegisub worked for me when I did the .ass files.\n\nLibrary Wars, English Subtitles translated from existing Chinese... this took a couple days, if you don't like it then do it yourself.\n\nOver 1,500 lines here in the subtitles that was originally Chinese &gt; if it is not in English then the text was not available in Chinese for translation. This was not translated by somebody fluent in Chinese. bing was the simplest and most reliable but each line had to be done individually.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:475a0daf375e05250c213cd8c358c89e82dfda91","amp;dn":"Library.Wars_English.sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"475a0daf375e05250c213cd8c358c89e82dfda91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,90,13,175,55,94,5,37,12,33,60,216,195,88,200,158,130,223,218,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
