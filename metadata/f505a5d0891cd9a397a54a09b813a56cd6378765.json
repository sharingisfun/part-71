A journey that will pit them against their own worst fears and the most terrible dangers- both human and undead.\n\nA journey through a wasteland now known as Zombiestan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f505a5d0891cd9a397a54a09b813a56cd6378765","amp;dn":"+Mainak+Dhar+-+Zombiestan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f505a5d0891cd9a397a54a09b813a56cd6378765","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,5,165,208,137,28,217,163,151,165,74,9,184,19,165,108,214,55,135,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
