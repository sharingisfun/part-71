If you are having these issues or know\n\nof any other Video Player that will not go above 30FPS please bring it to\n\nmy attention. You may always re-encode the video with a free program called \n\nHandBrake or VidCoder. If the problem is that big of a deal and I get\n\nenough requests I can post 2 copies one at 59.95FPS and one at 29.97FPS.
