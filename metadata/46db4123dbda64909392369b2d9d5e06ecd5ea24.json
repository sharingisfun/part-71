Result is a much smaller file (1.1GB instead of 4.5GB) and the noisy/grainy picture is smoothened, while practically no quality loss. Enjoy.\n\nMovie description (IMDb):\nAn Albanian family is torn apart by a murder, resulting in a blood feud that finds Nik becoming the prime target and his sister, Rudina, forced to leave school in order to take over the family business.\n\nScreenshots:\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46db4123dbda64909392369b2d9d5e06ecd5ea24","amp;dn":"The.Forgiveness.of.Blood.%282011%29.720p.H264.heAdbrAke","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46db4123dbda64909392369b2d9d5e06ecd5ea24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,219,65,35,219,218,100,144,147,146,54,155,45,157,94,6,236,213,234,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
