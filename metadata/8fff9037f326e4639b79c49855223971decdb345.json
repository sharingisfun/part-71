The DVD/video presents Houston performing live at the Naval Air Station in Norfolk, Virginia on March 31, 1991. The video was originally released on May 14, 1991, and the DVD was released in 2002. The concert was dedicated to the troops, their families, and military and government dignitaries in honor of those returning from the Gulf War.\n\nThis is the Japanese Import version, Lossless DVD rip with menus left out. The best version of this concert out there. Strangely the best full concert recording of Whitney Houston, the best female pop singer that ever lived, exists. Unfortunately it contains burned in Japanese subs, but not that annoying. Forget the Amazon version, go for this free version.\n\nI don't mind if you leave your gratitude in the form of comments/feedback!\n\nGlobal specs:\n\nSystem:       NTSC\nAspect Ratio: 4:3\nLength:       1:16:08\nAudio:        LPCM stereo\n\n\nTracks:\n\n&quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot;\n&quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot;\n&quot;How Will I Know&quot;\nLove Song Medley:\n &quot;Didn't We Almost Have It All&quot;\n &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot;\n &quot;Where Do Broken Hearts Go&quot;\n&quot;All the Man That I Need&quot;\n&quot;My Name Is Not Susan&quot;\n&quot;Anymore&quot;\n&quot;A Song for You&quot;\n&quot;Revelation&quot;\n&quot;Who Do You Love&quot;\n&quot;I'm Your Baby Tonight&quot;\n&quot;Greatest Love of All&quot;\n\n\nDetails:\nFormat                                   : MPEG-PS\nFile size                                : 1 024 MiB\nDuration                                 : 18mn 27s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 7 758 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 224 (0xE0)\nFormat                                   : MPEG Video\nFormat version                           : Version 2\nFormat profile                           : Main@Main\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : Yes\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Default\nFormat settings, GOP                     : M=2, N=18\nDuration                                 : 18mn 26s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 6 068 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                         : 7 927 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 4:3\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nStandard                                 : NTSC\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Interlaced\nScan order                               : Top Field First\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.586\n\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 189 (0xBD)-160 (0xA0)\nFormat                                   : PCM\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nFormat settings, Sign                    : Signed\nMuxing mode                              : DVD-Video\nDuration                                 : 18mn 27s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 1 536 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nDelay relative to video                  : -656ms\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fff9037f326e4639b79c49855223971decdb345","amp;dn":"Whitney+Houston+Live%3A+Welcome+Home+Heroes+%281991%29+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fff9037f326e4639b79c49855223971decdb345","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,255,144,55,243,38,228,99,155,121,196,152,85,34,57,113,222,205,179,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
