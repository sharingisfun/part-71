The Warner Brothers (and the Warner Sister), Yakko, Wakko and Dot really show the anchorman no mercy in this cartoon, absolutely destroying him. It makes for one of the show's funniest episodes. But the FOX Network felt that the show had gone too far this time, and so quite a bit of footage was cut out from this one before it could be aired in America. The anchor was also renamed &quot;Dan Anchorman,&quot; and various scenes rewritten and redubbed.\n\n   The episode aired uncut in other countries.\n\n   I've used part of a Boomerang airing along with the American version of the episode and some rare audio to restore most of this episode as it was originally intended. You'll still hear a few references to &quot;Dan Anchorman&quot; but the bulk of the episode is uncut and uncensored.\n\n   DVD-ish format.\n\n\nAnimaniacs Season 1 Episode 41:\nButtermilk, It Makes a Body Bitter/Broadcast Nuisance/Raging Bird\nAir date:\t September 17, 1993\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:447d2fbfec639cfd07464f4f3a4303f97f274f95","amp;dn":"Animaniacs+Broadcast+Nuisance+Uncut+Uncensored","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"447d2fbfec639cfd07464f4f3a4303f97f274f95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,125,47,191,236,99,156,253,7,70,79,79,58,67,3,249,127,39,79,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
