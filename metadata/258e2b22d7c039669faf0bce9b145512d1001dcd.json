It is implied that the title of the manga is derived from the &quot;good endings&quot; that are achieved in harem visual novels. Although the story was once concluded in the one shot version, the full version includes identical characters and settings.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:258e2b22d7c039669faf0bce9b145512d1001dcd","amp;dn":"GE%3A+Good+Ending+-+Vol.+01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"258e2b22d7c039669faf0bce9b145512d1001dcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,142,43,34,215,192,57,102,159,175,11,206,155,20,85,18,209,0,29,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
