Creating a cartoon character will give us a chance to look at how those tools can be used to model organic shapes, follow existing designs, and finish with texture maps. Our design will be a simple but appealing one that will allow us to concentrate on the tools and techniques while creating something fun. We'll start by adding images to use as reference and then begin building up the geometry from scratch. We'll build and shape the main body before spending some time creating more complex topology for the head. Tools like Loop Slice, Edge Slice, and Bevel will help us create our character quickly and efficiently. We'll also create parts like the teeth, eyes, and horns from primitive shapes or by using our existing geometry. Once our model is built, we'll spend some time looking at UV layouts and then create some color textures for the character. In addition, we'll add some bump to the character as well as some ambient occlusion. In the end you'll have a finished cartoon character ready for rigging and animation as well as the knowledge you need to create models from your own designs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f23853af10f26b76c3a31c381ce07534a14cf17","amp;dn":"Creating+Cartoon+Characters+in+MODO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f23853af10f26b76c3a31c381ce07534a14cf17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,35,133,58,241,15,38,183,108,58,49,195,129,206,7,83,74,20,207,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
