More broadly the term is used in a wide number of contexts for an image, picture, or representation; it is a sign or likeness that stands for an object by signifying or representing it either concretely or by analogy, as in semiotics; by extension, icon is also used, particularly in modern culture, in the general sense of symbol Ã¢â‚¬â€ i.e. a name, face, picture, edifice or even a person readily recognized as having some well-known significance or embodying certain qualities: one thing, an image or depiction, that represents something else of greater significance through literal or figurative meaning, usually associated with religious, cultural, political, or economic standing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b38c3eafb7f8545d164e1c3e1eecc81f6c51f6c7","amp;dn":"Shield+icon+uac-shield.ico","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b38c3eafb7f8545d164e1c3e1eecc81f6c51f6c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,140,62,175,183,248,84,93,22,78,28,62,30,236,200,31,108,81,246,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
