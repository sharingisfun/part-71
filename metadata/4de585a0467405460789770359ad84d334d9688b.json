Under SwarteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own exacting supervision, Is That All There Is? collects virtually all of his alternative comics work from 1972 to date, including the RAW magazine stories that brought him fame among American comics aficionados in the 1980s. Especially great pains have been taken to match SwarteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s superb coloring, including stories executed in watercolor, comics printed in retro duotones, fiendishly clever use of Zip-a-Tone screens, and much more. Other noteworthy stories include SwarteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s take on an episode from HergÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s early days, a Fats Domino story, a tribute to the legendary Ã¢â‚¬Å“Upside-DownsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ strip, and a story titled simply Ã¢â‚¬Å“Modern Art.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4de585a0467405460789770359ad84d334d9688b","amp;dn":"Joost+Swarte+-+Is+That+All+There+Is%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4de585a0467405460789770359ad84d334d9688b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,229,133,160,70,116,5,70,7,137,119,3,89,173,132,211,52,217,104,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
