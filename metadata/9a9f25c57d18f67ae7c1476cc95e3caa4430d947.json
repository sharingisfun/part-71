These tapers didnt have access to SVHS so \nthey sent submasters on high grade Maxell tape and this is a mix of these two shows, one cam is incomplete so its a mix for most of the show but eventually\nbecomes a single cam shot.\n\nI was doing some cleaning and went through some boxes of my old VHS collection and started pulling out some of my early mixing work.  In 1998 I started \nbuying up gear to mix the concert videos I was shooting with other tapers like Elvis Hitler.  I was very much into SVHS for submastering my camcorder\ntapes. I had two JVC HR-S4500 decks with jog/shuttle wheels.  The pain of synching up tapes by flashbulbs then jogging decks back and forth to synch.\nFor a myriad of reasons the tapes would lose synch and I would go back and fix over and over, hands flying all around the controls to try to keep \nthings in synch while mixing the best shots on the fly.  The cheesy graphics generator I had at the time, but back in the day, it was some cutting edge\nstuff that was not common in the bootleg video world.\n\nI did my very first 2 cam video mix by using 2 different angles of a Queensyche concert from St Louis while on the Empire tour, I put a few copies \ninto circulation but some time later after unfortunate circumstances, my tape was lost forever and I have never seen a Qrych Empire St Louis 2 cam mix\nvideo on any of the hundreds of trader lists I have seen over the years.  If anybody knows of such a tapes existance in a collection, I sure would be\ninterested in getting a copy back for nostalgia sake.\n\nAnyways, I thought with the handful of mix master tapes I have I would start to release them in a very basic fashion under a new label called the\nFinatic Analog Daze or &quot;FAD&quot; for short.  These DVDs will not be authored, I am simply playing the SVHS mix master tape into a Panasonic recorder\nand releasing them as is. I will probably have 10-12 of them to release over time as I have free time to work on the project.\n\nSet list from www.setlist.fm\n\nIn the Flesh\n(Pink Floyd song)\nThe Thin Ice\n(Pink Floyd song)\nAnother Brick in the Wall Part 1\n(Pink Floyd song)\nThe Happiest Days of Our Lives\n(Pink Floyd song)\nAnother Brick in the Wall Part 2\n(Pink Floyd song)\nMother\n(Pink Floyd song)\nGet Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert\n(Pink Floyd song)\nSouthampton Dock\n(Pink Floyd song)\nPigs on the Wing 1\n(Pink Floyd song)\nDogs\n(Pink Floyd song)\nWelcome to the Machine\n(Pink Floyd song)\nWish You Were Here\n(Pink Floyd song)\nShine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts I-V)\n(Pink Floyd song)\nSpeak to Me\n(Pink Floyd song)\nBreathe\n(Pink Floyd song)\nTime\n(Pink Floyd song)\nBreathe (Reprise)\n(Pink Floyd song)\nThe Great Gig in the Sky\n(Pink Floyd song)\nMoney\n(Pink Floyd song)\n5:06 AM (Every Stranger's Eyes)\nThe Powers That Be\nWhat God Wants, Part 1\nPerfect Sense (Parts 1 and 2)\nIt's a Miracle\nAmused to Death\nEncore:\nBrain Damage\n(Pink Floyd song)\nEclipse\n(Pink Floyd song)\nComfortably Numb \n\nIt is still a travesty that the Amused to Death album wasnt toured on its own with a complete large scale production.\nThe 99 tour gave us a taste of what might have been....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a9f25c57d18f67ae7c1476cc95e3caa4430d947","amp;dn":"Roger+Waters+Molson+Ampitheater+Toronto%2C+Canada+08-01-99","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a9f25c57d18f67ae7c1476cc95e3caa4430d947","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,159,37,197,125,24,246,122,231,193,71,108,201,94,60,170,68,48,217,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
