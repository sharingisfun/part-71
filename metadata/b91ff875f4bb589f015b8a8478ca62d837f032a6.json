A valid media player or device MUST have the ability to allow you to switch audio stream/tracks such as VLC or most smart tvs.\n\nThe primary AC-3 AKA DD5.1 audio track is provided for MAXIMUM surround sound capability and for pure bitstreaming support for those without AAC5.1-7.1 playback abilities, are restricted to using a digital connection using fiber/toslink/coax/spdif and doesn't have realtime dolby digital live or dts-connect abilities.\n\nAdditionally advantages of the AC-3 stream is flawless direct realtime downmixing to all stereo devices without any potential decoding issues anywhere along the line, be it using laptop/headphones or a dedicated stereo amplifier, it should reproduce very well.\n\nThose with 6/7/8 Channel HDMI using LPCM or direct analog connections, you should be fully capable of playing the 2nd stream to experience a full audio spectrum version of the movie. DTS-HD is incapable of provided more than 5.1 audio @ 1536kbps, AAC5.1 @ 960kbps or AAC7.1 @ 1280kbps should be unparalleled in terms of quality while providing the additional channels in the event of a movie being 6.1 or 7.1.\n\n\nScreenshot Previews:\n                                  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img545/5131/1ox0.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img545/5131/1ox0.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img854/2548/udnx.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img854/2548/udnx.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img716/4214/fmr9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img716/4214/fmr9.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img716/9382/aqpw.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img716/9382/aqpw.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img849/3962/jpfw.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img849/3962/jpfw.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img826/3703/4sdb.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img826/3703/4sdb.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img812/4445/xmfu.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img812/4445/xmfu.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img534/6321/th7p.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img534/6321/th7p.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img854/6805/ath4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img854/6805/ath4.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img138/5075/6rw4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img138/5075/6rw4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPlease, be patient with seeding...\n\nEnjoy ;)\n\nFeel free to leave a + vote and a comment, Thank You!\n\n\nJudas's Note:\n\nTime to get the best bang for the bit in audio too, Can't really get any better than this for an MP4.\n\nAdditionally this movie was placed onto a bluray along with a theatrical cut, much like the Donnie darko cut (in fact the Donnie darko movie had significantly higher bitrate/quality).... didn't have any significant &quot;remastering&quot; done to the bluray.... so it's not the CRISP clear awesome picture you would get from a modern movie. Looks precisely the same as the bluray though. It's rather unfortunate as the movie is visually stunning in many cases, but due to the nature of how the bluray was formatted, they decided to use VC-1 with a very low bitrate. I haven't actually compressed the movie at all much, since the original VC-1 raw bluray video file was just barely more than 13GB, you can see how little I actually compressed it. (For comparison Donnie darko was about 18GB for the video, the hobbit for example has a near full 35GB dedicated to just video...) So there really isn't much to be done.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b91ff875f4bb589f015b8a8478ca62d837f032a6","amp;dn":"Chronicles+of+Riddick+Unrated+DC+%282004%29+1080p+5.1+BDRip+x264+HQ+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b91ff875f4bb589f015b8a8478ca62d837f032a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,31,248,117,244,187,88,159,1,91,138,132,120,202,98,216,55,240,50,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
