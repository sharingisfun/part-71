Despite his martial ability and his political power, Munenori spent his life immersed in Zen teachings and practice. These teachings formed the framework for his deeply spiritual approach to sword fighting; Munenori saw in the practice of the sword a way to transform the student into a total human being. The Life-Giving Sword is MunenoriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s manifesto on his approach.\n\nTakuan Soho (1573-1645) was a prelate of the Rinzai Sect of Zen, well remembered for this strength of character and acerbic wit; and he was also gardener, poet, tea master, prolific author and a pivotal figure in Zen painting and calligraphy. \nIt is said that Takuan sought to infuse the spirit of Zen into every aspect of life that caught his interest, such things as calligraphy, poetry, gardening and the arts in general. This he also did with the art of the sword.\n\nWilliam Scott Wilson is the foremost translator into English of traditional Japanese texts on samurai culture. He received BA degrees from DartmouthCollege and the Monterey Institute of Foreign Studies, and an MA in Japanese literary studies from the University of Washington. His best-selling books include The Book of Five Rings, The Unfettered Mind, and The Lone Samurai, a biography of Miyamoto Musashi.\n\nTorrent content:\nThe Unfettered Mind epub\nThe Lone Samurai epub\nThe Life-Giving Sword epub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f86b281f2d06997b22011cc7bd2035db3ec60b41","amp;dn":"zen+sword+books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f86b281f2d06997b22011cc7bd2035db3ec60b41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,107,40,31,45,6,153,123,34,1,28,199,189,32,53,219,62,198,11,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
