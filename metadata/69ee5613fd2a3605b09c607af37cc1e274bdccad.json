IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure I can even explain things. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know when IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be back. IF IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be back. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure of anything, except that I love you, Ever. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re my twin, my best friend, and leaving you was the hardest thing IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever done. I know you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand. Maybe you never will. I hope you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, honestly. It would be easier that way. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cowardly, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure.\n\nCade, take care of her. Love her, the way she deserves. The way you always have, for forever and always. \n\nIf I could ask you anything, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that you remember me as I was, and forget me as I am. \n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sorry, and goodbye, and I love you.\n\nEden","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69ee5613fd2a3605b09c607af37cc1e274bdccad","amp;dn":"Jasinda+Wilder_Saving+Forver+%28Ever+Trilogy+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69ee5613fd2a3605b09c607af37cc1e274bdccad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,238,86,19,253,42,54,5,176,156,96,122,243,124,193,226,116,189,204,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
