Nine of the thirteen tracks feature guest vocalists, from Texas and Veba (the latter a Rae &amp; Christian regular) to the Jungle Brothers, Jeru the Damaja, and JVC Force. Surprisingly, R&amp;C are equally masterful on the dance tracks and the hip-hop cuts; though most of the songs aren't exactly barnburners, it's obvious that every aspect of these productions have been labored over. Dance listeners can always count on deep basslines, but hardly ones that are as intricate as they are on Northern Sulphuric Soul.
