The busy physician has a pediatrics practice in Dallas, and meeting Tom Peterson, and falling in love, is adding a rich layer to her life. She's sorting out how to introduce him to her family--she's the youngest of seven--and thinking about marriage.\n\nShe's falling in love with Jesus too, and knows God is good. But that faith is about to be tested in a way she didn't expect, and the results will soon transform her entire family.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00d453873b6ec57bcd15155a5753268a10707784","amp;dn":"Dee+Henderson-Jennifer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00d453873b6ec57bcd15155a5753268a10707784","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,212,83,135,59,110,197,123,205,21,21,90,87,83,38,138,16,112,119,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
