After all, light feeling forever united their hearts. But the terrible Yugoslav war breaks into civilian life, smashing and breaking everything. Former good neighbors suddenly become bitter enemies. Cities and villages turn into a battlefield. Keep love and protect the happiness in this hell - an impossible task ...\n\nReview: Yugoslavian film Vukovar, jedna prica about a Yugoslav civil war, made in the midst of the war itself. Illuminated initial period of the Serbo-Croatian conflict and the siege of Vukovar, and in the center of the story - the fate of a multinational family, shared the tragic events.\n\nNot very objective, but emotionally. As the movie filmed in Yugoslavia, the Croatian military is still displayed in a negative light compared to the Serbs and the JNA soldiers. However, to outright propaganda it does not reach, and the general idea that runs through the entire film, &quot;all to blame.&quot; As in the film &quot;Beautiful village beautifully lit&quot; on the war in Bosnia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc1875a463746fbf664c1e31c26585271e0442ab","amp;dn":"%E9%A9%9A%E8%AE%8A%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%2FVukovar%2C+jedna+pri%C4%8Da%281994%29Jan%26amp%3BChi+subbed%2Cby+%E5%BF%83%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84%E9%99%BD%E5%85%89","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc1875a463746fbf664c1e31c26585271e0442ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,24,117,164,99,116,111,191,102,76,30,49,194,101,133,39,30,4,66,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
