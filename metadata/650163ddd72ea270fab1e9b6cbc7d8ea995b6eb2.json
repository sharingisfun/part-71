The score by Marvin Hamlisch and Edward Kleban is a favorite of &quot;theater people&quot; everywhere, but was designed to showcase the abilities of dancers rather than singers. Consequently, only the ballad &quot;What I Did for Love&quot; has had a life outside of the show's context. This reissue of the original Broadway cast recording of A Chorus Line contained the previously unreleased &quot;Montage, Pt. 1: Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love&quot;, plus extensive liner notes featuring memorabilia, cast listings, and previously unpublished photos.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01.
