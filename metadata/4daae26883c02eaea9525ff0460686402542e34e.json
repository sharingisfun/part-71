Democrats view Lewinsky as a tramp whose goal it was to seduce and bring down a President.  Monica Lewinsky views herself as neither.  In this book, she describes how she was a willing participant in her affair with President Clinton, and would not have divulged it, if not for perjury charges brought against her by the Ken Starr commission, after Linda Tripp provided taped phone conversation showing that Lewinsky did indeed lie about her relationship.  She has nothing but contempt for the Starr commission, but feels unjustly maligned by the White House, the people she was trying to protect.  A fascinating story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4daae26883c02eaea9525ff0460686402542e34e","amp;dn":"Monica%27s+Story+-+Monica+Lewinsky%27s+side+of+the+Clinton+Affair","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4daae26883c02eaea9525ff0460686402542e34e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,170,226,104,131,192,46,174,169,82,95,240,70,6,134,64,37,66,227,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
