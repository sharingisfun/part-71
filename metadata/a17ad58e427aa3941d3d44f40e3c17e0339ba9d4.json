More broadly the term is used in a wide number of contexts for an image, picture, or representation; it is a sign or likeness that stands for an object by signifying or representing it either concretely or by analogy, as in semiotics; by extension, icon is also used, particularly in modern culture, in the general sense of symbol Ã¢â‚¬â€ i.e. a name, face, picture, edifice or even a person readily recognized as having some well-known significance or embodying certain qualities: one thing, an image or depiction, that represents something else of greater significance through literal or figurative meaning, usually associated with religious, cultural, political, or economic standing.\nThroughout history, various religious cultures[2] have been inspired or supplemented by concrete images, whether in two dimensions or three. The degree to which images are used or permitted, and their functions Ã¢â‚¬â€ whether they are for instruction or inspiration, treated as sacred objects of veneration or worship, or simply applied as ornament Ã¢â‚¬â€ depend upon the tenets of a given religion in a given place and time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a17ad58e427aa3941d3d44f40e3c17e0339ba9d4","amp;dn":"help+icon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a17ad58e427aa3941d3d44f40e3c17e0339ba9d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,122,213,142,66,122,163,148,29,61,68,244,14,60,23,224,51,155,169,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
