Presented as a series of comic novellas that together comprise a thoughtful, sometimes dark and often hilarious memoir about childhood, family, death, mental illness, sex and drug use, the entire book is told through cleverly inviting conceits like cat histories and card games. The graphic novel is told in five parts: In Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thirteen CatsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (featured in The Best American Comics), Reklaw discovers coping mechanisms that mimic his family pets; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Toys I LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ relates the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pre-pubescent brushes with deviant sexual activity, and the way innocence converges with real sexual trauma; Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Fred Robinson StoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tells the story of ReklawÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s period stalking perfect strangers; Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Stacked Deck,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in which hereditary influences towards criminal behavior, drug use and depression are explored via card games the author played with his family; and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lessoned,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a family history of mental illness.
