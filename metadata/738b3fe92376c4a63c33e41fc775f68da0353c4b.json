His deputy sheriff job, plus battle injuries that ended his military career, keep him right where he wants to be: Off the ranch and away from his family's pity. His darkest war memories are on lockdown, leaving him skeptical he'll ever find a woman who wants a man who's less than whole.\nDomini Katzinski has had to control every aspect of her life since age eleven, when she was orphaned in the Ukraine. Watching others' relationships crumble has convinced her to focus on the short-term and find a take-charge man to whom she can relinquish total sexual control. Cam fits the bill: Gorgeous, with a brooding vulnerability no one else seems to see. Plus, he has his own handcuffs.
