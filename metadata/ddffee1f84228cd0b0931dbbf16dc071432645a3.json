As expected, these two sides are in conflict and Tench can be a little overbearing, but there are moments here that bring out the best in Beck. Namely, these are the times when the group ventures into extended, funk-inflected, reflective jazzy instrumental sections. These are the moments that point the way toward the success of Blow by Blow, yet this remains an unabashed rock record of its time, and it falls prey to many of its era's excesses, particularly lack of focus. Still, there are moments that are as fine as anything Beck played here. \n\nFrom wiki:\nRough and Ready is the third album by The Jeff Beck Group and the first of two by the second Jeff Beck Group. Released in 1971, it featured more of a jazz, soul and R&amp;B edge to counter Beck's lead guitar. As a songwriter, Beck contributed more pieces to Rough and Ready than he had before, or ever would again. Beck enlisted Bobby Tench as vocalist and it is also the first time keyboardist Max Middleton is heard. Other members of this line up are drummer Cozy Powell and bassist Clive Chaman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddffee1f84228cd0b0931dbbf16dc071432645a3","amp;dn":"Jeff+Beck+Group-+Rough+and+Ready+%281971%29+Vinyl+Rip+24-96","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddffee1f84228cd0b0931dbbf16dc071432645a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,255,238,31,132,34,140,208,176,147,29,187,241,109,192,113,67,38,69,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
