Mr. Newton and Mr. Gauss were engaged in-depth with numerical solutions for these problems. Today, there are improved algorithms, that can solve such tasks.\n\nInterReg allows you to do such complex calculations just with some point-and-click. So this program is not only for mathematics and engineers. The applications are many and reach from education over science to productive use in your company: in example a meaningful sales forecast can be done in minutes.\n\nOver this, the software offers some other functionality to do curve sketching, integration and statistics as well.\n\nFeatures:\n\nCalculates with arbitrary precision.\nEasy graphical usage and state-of-the-art algorithms\nWithout a complicated scripting language you are able to do some complex calculations with simple point-and-click.\nSo this software targets both mathematicians and non-mathematicians\nModern algorithms give exact results\nComprehensive import functions import sampling points from many different formats and databases\nInterpolation\nLinear Interpolation\nCubic Splines\nAkima Splines\nRegression\nRegression of arbitrary functions using:\nLBFGS algorithm (quasi-Newton operation)\nLevenberg-Marquardt algorithm\nCurve Sketching\nNumerical derivations, zero crossings, extreme values, inflection points\nCrossings of two curves\nTangents\nIntegrals\nIntegrals between the x-axis and between two curves:\nRomberg algorithm\nSimpson algorithm\nStatistics\nArithmetic mean value\nMedian\nTrend\nCorrelation (Pearson and Spearman)\nFunction Plotter\nPlotting of arbitrary function therms\nOther Features\nCartesian coordinate system\nOptional date/time values on the abscissa\nAny number of graphs and value lists\nPrinting\nCalculation and export of interpolated sample points\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nXP to Windows 8 (32 and 64-bit)\nDotNet Framework 4.0+\n\nHomepage: http://www.kroll-software.de\n\nInstallation Instructions: \n\n- Install program.\n- Use Keygen to register application.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:839fbb16f2cf04fe6346b8485e685e003a04b4b1","amp;dn":"KrollSoftware+InterReg+2014+v3.0.1+BILINGUAL+CRD+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"839fbb16f2cf04fe6346b8485e685e003a04b4b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,159,187,22,242,207,4,254,99,70,184,72,94,104,94,0,58,4,180,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
