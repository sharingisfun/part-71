Whether you are taking your first college chemistry course or still in high school, knowledge of chemical processes provides insights into a variety of biological and physical phenomena. These phenomena and more are explored in Professor Franklin OwÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s General Chemistry course. In each of his lessons, Professor Ow explains concepts in easy to understand language and follows with plenty of examples you will likely see on homework and exams. Lesson topics include Stoichiometry, Gases, Acid Base Reactions, and Electrochemistry. Professor Ow obtained both his BS and PhD in chemistry from the University of California, Los Angeles. He currently teaches chemistry classes at three universities and has won multiple awards in his academic field.\n\nTotal Length - 16:21","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17d3c7b16a2e3228e4934956e3fdbd93119dcc35","amp;dn":"Educator.com+-+General+Chemistry+with+Franklin+Ow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17d3c7b16a2e3228e4934956e3fdbd93119dcc35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,211,199,177,106,46,50,40,228,147,73,86,227,253,189,147,17,157,204,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
