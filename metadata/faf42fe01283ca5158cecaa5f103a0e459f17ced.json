Dragons, trolls, centaurs, and other monsters fill the world. The word comes from the council that everyone must leave and journey to rescue their leader, Janan, who has been abducted by a mysterious new enemy in the north. Faced with overwhelming threats that bring death and destruction, Sam and the others reach the northern Range and, reunited with Janan, are given an unimaginable opportunity. Although it would give them the privilege to live and learn and love without fear, the choice is not without its own dire consequences. And lives - though not theirs - are sure to be lost. Just how much are they willing to give up to save themselves?\nGenre: Fiction, Young Adult/Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faf42fe01283ca5158cecaa5f103a0e459f17ced","amp;dn":"Phoenix+Overture+-+Jodi+Meadows.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faf42fe01283ca5158cecaa5f103a0e459f17ced","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,244,47,224,18,131,202,81,88,206,202,165,241,3,160,228,89,241,124,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
