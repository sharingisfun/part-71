Headquartered in New York, it is published by Strategy&amp;,[1] formerly Booz &amp; Company, a member of the PricewaterhouseCoopers network. Prior to the separation of Booz &amp; Company from Booz Allen Hamilton in 2008, strategy+business was published by Booz Allen Hamilton, which launched the magazine, then titled Strategy &amp; Business, in 1995. Full issues of strategy+business now appear in print and digital form[2] on a quarterly basis, and other original material is regularly published on the website: strategy-business.com.[3]\n\nArticles cover a range of industry and organizational topics that are of interest to CEOs and other senior executives as well as to business thinkers, academics, and researchers. The articles, written in English, are authored by a mix of leading figures from both the executive suite and academia in addition to journalists and Strategy&amp; consultants.\n\nThe magazineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s founding editor-in-chief, Joel Kurtzman, coined the term thought leadership when he published interviews with influential business figures under the rubric Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thought Leaders.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ [4] Today, interviews with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thought LeadersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ remain a recurring column in the print magazine and on the website.\n\nOver the years, the magazineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contributors have included Warren Bennis, Stewart Brand, Nicholas Carr, Denise Caruso, Ram Charan, Glenn Hubbard, Sheena Iyengar, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Jon Katzenbach, A.G. Lafley, Franco Modigliani, Kenichi Ohmae, C.K. Prahalad (including his posthumous last article),[5] and Peter Senge. Those interviewed as thought leaders include Philip Bobbitt, John Chambers, Arie de Geus, Gary Hamel, Charles Handy, Daniel Kahneman, John Kao, Sylvia Nasar, Carlota Perez, Paul Romer, Anne-Marie Slaughter, and Meg Wheatley. The magazine also features the work of a variety of illustrators and photographers, including Guy Billout, Seymour Chwast, Lars Leetaru, Peter Gregoire, Dan Page, and Heads of State.\n\nStrategy+business also publishes an annual feature called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Best Business Books,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ [6] one of the few places where business books are evaluated and reviewed systematically. Writers of these essays (who select the books in each category) have included Frances Cairncross, Clive Crook, R. Gopalakrishnan, Sally Helgesen, Walter Kiechel III, Steven Levy, Nell Minow, James OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Toole, Howard Rheingold, Kenneth Roman, Phil Rosenzweig, Michael Schrage, David Warsh, and Dov Zakheim.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e72a1c68e6c3d53d8221fc36ec4b190f1f57e926","amp;dn":"Strategy%2BBusiness+-+Summer+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e72a1c68e6c3d53d8221fc36ec4b190f1f57e926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,42,28,104,230,195,213,61,130,33,252,54,236,75,25,15,31,87,233,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
