Defending champions United and Chelsea both have designs on the title but could not be separated in a goalless draw at Old Trafford - the first meeting of David Moyes and Jose Mourinho in their current jobs. Tottenham beat Swansea 1-0 early in the season and are in need of a repeat result as they target a top-four finish.\n\n\nNotes: Captured at 50fps to give more fluid and smoother movement.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19f8a619c05ec1bb3553c14d5f000c2550c9b638","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2+2014-01-19+720p+50fps+HDTV+x264-wAm.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19f8a619c05ec1bb3553c14d5f000c2550c9b638","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,248,166,25,192,94,193,187,53,83,193,77,95,0,12,37,80,201,182,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
