Raised by powerful cattle baron Judge Henry (Perlman), South, aka &quot;The Virginian&quot; (Adkins), lives his life as a ranch enforcer with bravery and steely determination. When a big-city writer (Penny) raises questions about the fierce treatment of rustlers, South is quick to defend the brutal realities of the &quot;Code of the West.&quot; But as he looks deeper into the latest string of rustling and finds his convictions questioned by a pretty new schoolteacher (Victoria Pratt, Mutant X), South begins to wonder if the Judge had ulterior motives in raising him to a life of bloodshed and violence in this explosive, action-loaded epic on the open range.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bc6db4f02d057014b767de4263851325f455a3a","amp;dn":"The+Virginian+%282014%29+1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bc6db4f02d057014b767de4263851325f455a3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,198,219,79,2,208,87,1,75,118,125,228,38,56,81,50,95,69,90,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
