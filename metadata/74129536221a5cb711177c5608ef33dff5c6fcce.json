In her heartfelt memoir, the six-time Grammy\nAward-winning singer and star of WE tv's hit reality series Braxton\nFamily Values is unapologetically honest in revealing the intimate\ndetails of her journey. Toni and the entire Braxton clan have become\nAmerica's favorite musical family, but what fans may not know is the\nintense guilt Toni once felt when she accepted a recording deal that\nexcluded her sisters. That decision would haunt Toni for years to\ncome, tainting the enormous fame she experienced as a popular female\nvocalist at the top of the charts. Despite her early accomplishments,\nToni's world crumbled when she was forced to file for bankruptcy\ntwice and was left all alone to pick up the pieces. \n\nUnbreak My Heart\nBy: Toni Braxton\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 400\nISBN: 9780062293282","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74129536221a5cb711177c5608ef33dff5c6fcce","amp;dn":"Unbreak+My+Heart+by+Toni+Braxton+%28Perseu%29+Epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74129536221a5cb711177c5608ef33dff5c6fcce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,18,149,54,34,26,92,183,17,23,124,86,8,239,51,223,245,198,252,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
