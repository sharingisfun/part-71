Despite the frustrating on-field inconsistencies of this towering talent, and the messy and very public personal troubles that have tracked him through the years, Herschelle remains one of South African cricketÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-loved sons\nIn To the Point, Herschelle talks very frankly about the ups and downs of his personal and professional life. He covers the big cricketing moments - from that dropped catch at the 1999 World Cup to the famous Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ438Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ game against Australia and the six sixes at the 2007 World Cup - as well as controversies off the field - the marijuana-smoking incident in the Caribbean, his problems with alcohol and his stint in rehab, his divorce, the multitude of women and the strip-club video. He also deals honestly with the match-fixing controversies Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and their repercussions.\nHerschelle gives his opinions on his teammates and the best players he has encountered over the years, and describes what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been like to be part of the Proteas set-up for the past fourteen years, through the controversies of its various captains and coaches.\nTo the Point is, of course, a spicy story of excess - women, alcohol, money Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and plenty of runs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but underlying it all is a warm and generous man who wears his heart on his sleeve.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cf75bc94f24991f18b955bb3151b7200a2b3530","amp;dn":"Herschelle+Gibbs+-+To+The+Point+%28Autobiography%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cf75bc94f24991f18b955bb3151b7200a2b3530","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,247,91,201,79,36,153,31,24,185,85,187,49,81,183,32,10,43,53,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
