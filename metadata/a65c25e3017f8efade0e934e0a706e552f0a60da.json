More specifically Muv-Luv Alternative OST vol.1 and vol.2 . For these 2 I decided to leave the original flac file on the folder instead of deleting it, with mind for those that want the best quality! Obviously I also have on the same folder the mp3 files I got from the big flac single files. \n\nThis torrent consists of a folder, &quot;Muv-Luv Series OST's&quot;, inside you will find:\n-MLA collection of Standard Edition songs;\n-Muv-Luv Altered Fable Main Theme Datte MUV-LUV nan da mon;\n-Muv-Luv Alternative OST (contains vol.1 and vol.2 both single filed as flac and also separated as single mp3 tracks, like I stated previously);\n-Muv-Luv Alternative Total Eclipse (contains bonus CD1, both OP and ED, the OST and the Song Collection);\n-Muv-Luv collection of Standard Edition songs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ divergence\n-MUV-LUV OST;\n-Muv-Luv Series Vocal Collection.\n\nMost albums are 320kbps, with one or two 192kbps, and the flac's.\n\nWith all in mind, I hope you enjoy, and share and seed.\nI for sure will seed this torrent has long as I can!! \n\nPS: EVERY song file (except the flac's) is fully edited in info! \nWith this I mean, interpreter, album interpreter, cover, album, date, track number, genre, compositor, etc. So you can just sit back relax and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a65c25e3017f8efade0e934e0a706e552f0a60da","amp;dn":"Muv-Luv+Series+OST+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a65c25e3017f8efade0e934e0a706e552f0a60da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,92,37,227,1,127,142,250,222,14,147,78,10,112,110,85,47,10,96,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
