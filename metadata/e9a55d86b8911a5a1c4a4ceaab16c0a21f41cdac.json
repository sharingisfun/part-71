Pick apart each sound and transcribe them to paper as you go, using the srt file as a guide until you have fairly memorized the movie.\nStep Two: Get a Japanese girlfriend/friends and try out variations of the gramamtical forms and vocabulary found throghout the movie in order to burn them into your memory. \n\nFor all of your anti-consumer society needs please see dirtyempire.com.\nHyper consumerism is what this movie is about, at least to a certain degree.\n\nI did all the corrections I could find but there still may be errors.
