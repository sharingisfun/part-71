You are on the road to becoming an adult. The adults around you are beginning to trust you to look after yourself and to make your own way. More and more, you will make decisions for yourself about the things that are important to you. With this freedom comes responsibility. What happens to your body and how you look after it are only part of the ride. You will encounter many new situations and new ideas: thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sex, \nand love, and how to keep feeling good about yourself, and how to get on with people. In this booklet, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got together a heap of information so that you can read up on the important stuff. Remember too that there are adults in your life, like your parents, teachers and school nurses, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be willing to listen and help you along the way. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:785b91a782f2cb1387e50f5459c4ff08d4ddf597","amp;dn":"Relationships-sex-%26amp%3B-other_stuff_booklet%5BDT123%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"785b91a782f2cb1387e50f5459c4ff08d4ddf597","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,91,145,167,130,242,203,19,135,229,15,84,89,196,255,8,212,221,245,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
