Give this a try? Features heavy riffs, comprehensible vocals, blended all together with hardcore roots and some kick ass guitar! Definitely a great band, deserving of all the support they can get. They aren't well known, so if you like this band, BUY THE ALBUMS! Just because they are on TPB now doesn't mean you can't show them support by buying albums or going to their shows.
