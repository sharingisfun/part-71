No need to close RoboForm before patching; the patch will kill the processes for you.  All you need to do is run the RoboForm TaskBar Icon after patching.\n\nSee included screen shots of both RF editions with and without Sync enabled.\n\nCurrently working on Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64 and Windows 8 Pro x64\n\nEnjoy!\n\nNOTE: To date, there is still no universal patch for roboform-x64.dll, so you will have to continue using a 32-bit browser or pay for a legitimate Roboform license to enable 64-bit browser support. (or find another patched roboform-x64.dll for this version of RF)\n\nNOTE 2: I have seen the rare comment that the patch doesn't work after version &quot;blah blah blah&quot; (it's always different).  If at first you don't succeed, try running the patch a 2nd time.\n\nVirusTotal results for the patch reveal 'generic' malware flags (6/46) since it IS a functional patcher.\nResults URL: https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/5663a7ec1fc12f19fc6a582340960bcf8d6f7435f9328d39467081bfd046badf/analysis/1367295054/\n\n----------------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.roboform.com/support/news&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.roboform.com/support/news&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNews and details from current and past versions of RoboForm.\n\nWindows Version News\n\nVersion 7.9.3 -- Jan 27, 2014 \n* Chrome 32+: whitelist RoboForm plugin, so that Chrome does not complain about it. \n* Chrome 32+: fix wrong positioning of RF windows (AutoFill, menus, minidialogs). \n* Chrome 32+: fix Basic Auth does not auto-fill or auto-save. \n* Firefox: fix RF installer may show 'Access Denied' message when registering with FF. \n* Firefox: fix saving passcard on a web page without favicon, it saves prevously saved icon. \n* Firefox: fix RF asserts when executing manual SaveForms command on sites without site icon. \n* Opera: fix Opera 18 adapter is not shown in Installed Adapters List in RF Options. \n* Import: replace characters not acceptable to Windows with '_'. \n* Fix URLs shown in RF anti-phishing warning are too long, show only mismatched domains. \n* Fix asserts when filling froms from Identity on ashampoo.com. \n* Win32: fix RF not matching password field in some MSAA forms. \n* Fix filling login credentials on Fidelity.com login page. \n* AutoUpdate: do not check versions of discontinued products. \n* AutoUpdate: correctly handle proxy authentication. \n* Installer: fix Closer sometimes not showing process icons. \n* Fox RF tray icon menu opens at the current mouse location instead of next to RF tray icon. \n* Toolbars: show a minidialog by mouse click when there is no mouse over (touch screen). \n* Fix RF tray icon app is not started when user enters Master Password and AutoLogoff is On. \n* Fix RF Editor position shifts up when Windows taskbar is placed on top (left) of the screen. \n* Enterprise only: add policies for logging of user actiivty. \n* Preparations for full client-server architecture. \n* Local file management: switch to '/' paths for better multi-platform compatibility.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c8e95113bd7f3835229844397680303cb1af110","amp;dn":"AI+RoboForm+7.9.3.3+Pro+Desktop+RoboForm2Go+%5Bonttm%5D+patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c8e95113bd7f3835229844397680303cb1af110","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,142,149,17,59,215,243,131,82,41,132,67,151,104,3,3,203,26,241,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
