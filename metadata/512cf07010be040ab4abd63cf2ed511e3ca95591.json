In the first round, lamb ribs are the Down Under favorite that the chefs must make their own, and a very alcoholic beverage leads some chefs down a dangerously fiery path. Then in the entree round, fans of emu fan fillets will be happy about what's inside the basket? And in the dessert round, the settings on the ice cream machine trip up one of the finalists, while the judges are on the edge of their seats, wondering if the mistake can be corrected in time.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 20-May-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:512cf07010be040ab4abd63cf2ed511e3ca95591","amp;dn":"Chopped.S20E03.Gday.Chefs.HDTV.x264-pwe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"512cf07010be040ab4abd63cf2ed511e3ca95591","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,44,240,112,16,190,4,10,180,171,214,60,242,237,81,30,60,169,85,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
