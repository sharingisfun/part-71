Hurley and Pope Pius XII\t\nBook Author: Charles R. Gallagher (Author)\nHardcover: 304 pages\nPublisher: Yale University Press (June 10, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0300121342\nISBN-13: 978-0300121346\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nIn the corridors of the Vatican on the eve of World War II, American Catholic priest Joseph Patrick Hurley found himself in the midst of secret diplomatic dealings and intense debate. HurleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deeply felt American patriotism and fixed ideas about confronting Nazism directly led to a mighty clash with Pope Pius XII. It was 1939, the earliest days of PiusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s papacy, and controversy within the Vatican over policy toward Nazi Germany was already heated. This groundbreaking book is both a biography of Joseph Hurley, the first American to achieve the rank of nuncio, or Vatican ambassador, and an insiderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s view of the alleged silence of the pope on the Holocaust and Nazism.\nDrawing on HurleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unpublished archives, the book documents critical debates in Pope PiusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Vatican, secret U.S.-Vatican dealings, the influence of DetroitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flamboyant anti-Semitic priest Charles E. Coughlin, and the controversial case of CroatiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cardinal Stepinac. The book also sheds light on the powerful connections between religion and politics in the twentieth century.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;Joseph P. Hurley, though a little-known figure, was at the center of many intriguing diplomatic episodes.
