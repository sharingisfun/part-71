Uriah Heep's progressive/art rock/heavy metal fusion's distinctive features have always included a massive keyboard sound, strong vocal harmonies and (in the early years) David Byron's quasi-operatic vocals. Twelve of the band's albums have made it to the UK Albums Chart (Return to Fantasy reached No. 7 in 1975) while of the fifteen Billboard 200 Uriah Heep albums Demons and Wizards was the most successful (#23, 1972). In the late 1970s the band had massive success in Germany, where the &quot;Lady in Black&quot; single was a big hit. Along with Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep had become one of the top bands in the early 1970s - one of &quot;The Big 4&quot; of hard rock.\n\nUriah Heep's audience declined by the 1980s, to the point where they became essentially a cult band in the United Kingdom and United States. The band maintains a significant following and performs at arena-sized venues in the Balkans, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia and Scandinavia. They have sold over 30 million albums worldwide with over 4 million sales in the U.S.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29af9f7f732aa1fb1cff2bd6c5a239960208a35e","amp;dn":"Uriah+Heep+Vinyl+Collection+1970-2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29af9f7f732aa1fb1cff2bd6c5a239960208a35e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,175,159,127,115,42,161,251,28,255,43,214,197,162,57,150,2,8,163,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
