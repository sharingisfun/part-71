Griffith\n\nA genuine Allied Artists double feature from 1957\n\nShout! Factory DVD, 2011\n\nMPEG-4 Nero Digital AVC\nWidescreen format\nHE-AAC Audio\n\nEach film has TWO audio tracks. The first, primary track is the film's original audio track.  The second track is a running commentary provided by the Brunas brothers and Tom Weaver (authors of Universal Horrors).\n\nBe careful if you play these films in Windows Media Player because that media player seems unable to select one or the other audio track -- it plays both at once! Remember I warned you about this --\n\nVLC Media Player and Nero Show Time both play these files properly, so you can choose which audio track you wish to hear.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baf87e7ec28c449e4d194402362e3e0d60669c8b","amp;dn":"Roger+Corman+Double+Feature+1957","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baf87e7ec28c449e4d194402362e3e0d60669c8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,248,126,126,194,140,68,158,77,25,68,2,54,46,62,13,96,102,156,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
