But the Doctor soon realises an even more gruesome fate awaits them - they have been infected with fatal spectrox toxaemia, and there is no cure...\n\nHunted by both factions and with death just hours away, how far must the Doctor go in order to save his friend's life?\n\nDirect DVD to MKV rips, no compression.\n\nAlso, the Doctor's companion, Peri, makes my head hurt. I never knew American accents could sound so bad, and I live there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0f89622a30829632627f676c3aec73b2fd92660","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+The+Caves+of+Androzani","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0f89622a30829632627f676c3aec73b2fd92660","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,248,150,34,163,8,41,99,38,39,246,118,195,174,199,59,47,217,38,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
