But what if you're new to motion graphics? Motion Graphics for Video Editors breaks the workflow down into easily understandable chunks, showing how to use the tools most video editors already haveÃ¢â‚¬â€in Adobe Creative CloudÃ¢â‚¬â€to complete basic motion graphics tasks. In this course, Rich Harrington introduces a few different ways to get and prep logos that are the right format and resolution, and use Photoshop or Illustrator to convert the files into layered images that are ready to animate. The real work then takes place in After Effects, where Rich shows how to animate the logo and add reflections, cast shadows, patterns, texture, and glows that will impress your future clients.\n\nThis course was created and produced by RHED Pixel.
