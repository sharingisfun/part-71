It was originally set for release on 25 June 2012 under the name of Swings and Roundabouts, but was held back twice; under the new self-titled name and was name changed and released on 27 May 2013. &quot;Love Me&quot; was released on 4 March 2012 as the album's lead single, peaking at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Black Heart&quot; was released as the second single on 15 June 2012 and became the group's highest charting single to date, peaking at number 3. The third single from the album was initially intended to be &quot;Waterfalls&quot;, a cover of the TLC song, which was released on 11 November 2012; however, Stooshe later revealed that it would not make the cut for the final tracklist and that they were disowning it. &quot;Slip&quot; was released as the album's third single on 12 May 2013, peaking at number 12.\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Slip\n[02] Love Me - - - Stooshe Featuring Travie McCoy\n[03] Black Heart\n[04] Jimmy\n[05] My Man Music\n[06] Kiss Chase\n[07] Round 2\n[08] Hoochi Mumma\n[09] Your Own Kind Of Beautiful\n[10] Put The Kettle On\n[11] Perfectly Wrong\n[12] See Me Like This\n[13] Fly Again\n[14]  Turning Me On\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:50m:39s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 382mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
