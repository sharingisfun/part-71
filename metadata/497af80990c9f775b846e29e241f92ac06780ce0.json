The fallen Witch, Lynessa, and her sister, Zina, are fading into memory like a bad dream, soon to be remembered only in tales meant to frighten children.

Soon the people of Oz will face a foe more frightening than any enemy that has come before... The Warlord of Oz has arrived! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:497af80990c9f775b846e29e241f92ac06780ce0","amp;dn":"Grimm+Fairy+Tales+Presents+-+Warlord+of+OZ+Issue+1+%28PDF%29+-+May+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"497af80990c9f775b846e29e241f92ac06780ce0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,122,248,9,144,201,247,117,184,70,226,158,36,31,146,172,6,120,12,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
