Is she a brave and reckless heroine taking on a monstrous evil? Or is she a deranged angel of death? One thing is clear: whether she is dropping from a high window into a crowd of red-robed fanatical cultists, or facing down a horde of psychotic hillbillies, you don't want to get in her way.\n\nA fast moving, self-contained story, Violenzia is a blast of pulpy fun, told in scenes of audacious action and splashes of rich watercolors. With elements of golden age comics and old movies mixed with Sala's trademark humor and sense of the absurd, Violenzia is serious fun, a bloody enigma masked as eye candy, a puzzle box riddled with bullet holes.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cad9306a9904b4eec5d3f7033b7d52ecc991b54c","amp;dn":"Richard+Sala+-+Violenzia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cad9306a9904b4eec5d3f7033b7d52ecc991b54c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,217,48,106,153,4,180,238,197,211,247,3,59,125,82,236,201,145,181,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
