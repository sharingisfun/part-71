Sent on assignment to Bali, Jamie, an American adventure guide, imagines spending weeks exploring the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lush jungles and pristine white sand beaches. Yet three days after her arrival, she is caught in BaliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infamous nightclub bombings, which irreparably change her life and leave her with many unanswered questions.\n\nOne year later, haunted by memories, Jamie returns to Bali seeking a sense of closure. Most of all, she hopes to find Gabe, the man who saved her from the attacks. She hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been able to forget his kindnessÃ¢â‚¬â€or the spark between them as he helped her heal. Checking into a cozy guest house for her stay, Jamie meets the kindly owner, who is coping with a painful past of his own, and a young boy who improbably becomes crucial to her search. Jamie has never shied away from a challenge, but a second chance with Gabe presents her with the biggest dilemma of all: whether sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ready to open her heart.\n\nGenre: Contemporary Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:472ca74200ebd6db696caced5d52f19f546590ba","amp;dn":"The+Paradise+Guest+House+by+Ellen+Sussman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"472ca74200ebd6db696caced5d52f19f546590ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,44,167,66,0,235,214,219,105,108,172,237,93,82,241,159,84,101,144,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
