Knoppix includes recent Linux software and desktop environments, including such applications as LibreOffice, Abiword, Gimp, Konqueror, Iceweasel, Apache, PHP, MySQL and hundreds of other quality open source programs.\n\n\n\n  Notes:\n\t\nv7.3 was released exclusively via the April 2014 issue of Linux Pro Magazine (Linux Magazine in the EU) and at CeBIT 2014.
