They have been organized by broad genres then specific games. A lot of genres got tossed in the misc section because they were small. In a brief rundown, the largest collections are from various 3d beat 'em up games (Devil May Cry, God Hand, Bayonetta), fighting games (Street Fighter, Smash Bros, Guilty Gear), and first person shooters (Quake, TF2, Counter Strike). There is a small section for speedruns, including some TAS.\n\nIf you are intimidated by the 63 GB filesize, then remember you can choose which part of the torrent you are downloading in your client. I would like it if you torrented it in whole if you are capable of doing so, but I leave that up to you.\n\nThank you for helping me share what I have been able to discover. Please take the time to read the readme.txt file in the actual torrent for more information.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc6a6143b3de5d9cbdc2cced6249ebfc97ada26d","amp;dn":"Vidya+Skill+Videos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc6a6143b3de5d9cbdc2cced6249ebfc97ada26d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,106,97,67,179,222,93,156,189,194,204,237,98,73,235,252,151,173,162,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
