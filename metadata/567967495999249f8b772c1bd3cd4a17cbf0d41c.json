While it is technically their third best-of compilation, following 1989's Great Southern Land and 1992's Masterfile (not counting a singles box set released in the mid-1990s that was not widely distributed), it is the first such compilation spanning the band's entire career, including both their early- to mid-1980s hits and material from their most commercially successful period, beginning with the Man of Colours album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:567967495999249f8b772c1bd3cd4a17cbf0d41c","amp;dn":"Icehouse+-+White+Noise","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"567967495999249f8b772c1bd3cd4a17cbf0d41c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,121,103,73,89,153,36,159,139,119,44,27,211,205,74,23,203,240,212,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
