The unfortunate souls left behind by this &quot;rapture&quot; will endure seven horrible years of tribulation, at the end of which Christ will return to earth for a glorious thousand-year reign.\n\nToday, millions accept this end-times theology, assuming Ã¢â‚¬â€ as Currie did Ã¢â‚¬â€ that the Bible clearly teaches it. Many plan their lives around it. But, after studying Scripture for decades, Currie has come to see that accepting the Bible means rejecting the rapture.\n\nIn this remarkable book Ã¢â‚¬â€ the world's most careful and thorough scriptural study of the rapture Ã¢â‚¬â€ Currie demonstrates why. He considers all the relevant verses (there are hundreds!) and examines them in the light of ancient history, the writings of the earliest Christians, and the claims of the rapturist theologians. With painstaking thoroughness, he unlocks the meaings of key biblical prophecies that culminate in Christ's Messianic Kingdom Ã¢â‚¬â€ including those verses in Daniel, Matthew, and Revelation that rapturists turn to most.\n\nMarshaling evidence as startling as it is compelling, Currie argues that these prophecies of war and tribulation don't point to some still-unrealized apocalyptic future. Rather, most of them were fulfilled long ago: the spiritual, priestly Kingdom prefigured in the Old Testament was inaugurated on Calvary, consumated in 70 A.D. with the destruction of the Temple, and continues to exist today... the Catholic Church!\n\nThat may surprise you. Yet, as Currie shows, it's the only conclusion that fits all the scriptural and historical evidence.\n\nRapture: The End-Times Error that Leaves the Bible Behind makes Scripture, prophecy, and history come alive; and it demonstrates that if you open your Bible, you'll find that God's plan for the future of the world is not filled with darkness and disaster, but with light, mercy, and hope.\n\nMore: https://thepiratebay.se/user/ancapcatholic\n\nBTC: 1N3Y2HNWe3xWY4qdYricHRKz58zqqi5MZp\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b488155e158b5dbda1b5f0f19ce9ec806f6bfae","amp;dn":"Rapture%3A+The+End-Times+Error+That+Leaves+the+Bible+Behind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b488155e158b5dbda1b5f0f19ce9ec806f6bfae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,72,129,85,225,88,181,219,218,27,95,15,25,206,158,200,6,246,191,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
