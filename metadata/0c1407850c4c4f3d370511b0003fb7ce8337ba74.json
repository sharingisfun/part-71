Think about all the other people on the train with you, what their lives are or have been, the different experiences youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve all had. But there is one thing that you undoubtedly all share: you have all been in love at one time or another. Taking in Paris, Poussin, six-stringed sitars and the best-maintained railway siding in Australia, this is the story of four people Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all strangers to one another Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who met on a train, and of how love touched their lives in very different ways.
