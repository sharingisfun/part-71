This is why we have created a software named SkyHighSim Scenery Toolbox which enables you to change the textures of the trees and some man-made structures. The software is distributed with our sceneries and installed automatically. This software also enables you to disable some of the scenery features to improve your FPS.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cb072c6c4a64349abd5fd75e01e4b7c8f7a3a82","amp;dn":"LDOS+-+OsijekX.7Z","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cb072c6c4a64349abd5fd75e01e4b7c8f7a3a82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,176,114,198,196,166,67,73,171,213,253,117,224,30,75,124,143,122,58,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
