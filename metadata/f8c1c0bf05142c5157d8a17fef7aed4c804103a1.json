It has: \n\n kernel-3.14.2-EmSee-pae \n wine-1.7.17, QQ2013 \n Jack \n Jack-rack/eq/mixer \n python2.7 \n cups 1.5.3 \n vlc \n zarfy \n \n\n It is a stepping-stone build. But very functional. \n\n \n QQ2013 is normally a .deb package which decompresses to 500mb as it has a 200mb tar.gz compressed and patched wine prefix, I got rid of the tar.gz saving 200mb....plus some optimisations so that wine (36mb pet) uses the same prefix - by making ~/.wine a symlink to ~/.longene/qq, so you can see it is a relatively small puppy! \n\n EDIT: I found that jackd is running on startup so in order to get sound with vlc etc open a terminal and type killall jackd ! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8c1c0bf05142c5157d8a17fef7aed4c804103a1","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_Dpup_Wheezy_archive_25-May-2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8c1c0bf05142c5157d8a17fef7aed4c804103a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,193,192,191,5,20,44,81,87,216,161,127,239,122,237,76,128,65,3,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
