We'll begin by exploring the animation interface followed by learning about animation preferences and settings and how to create key frames. In addition, we'll learn how animations can be modified from MODO's Timeline, Graph Editor, and Dope Sheet. \n\nAlong the way we'll also learn about how to edit animations on a motion path, animate a camera to follow a path, and how to save poses and actions for our animations. By the end, you'll be equipped with an understanding of some really useful tools and features you'll need to animate inside of MODO.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cd1493f29d441e654d740f308c31d9ac3f7443a","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Animation+in+MODO+-+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cd1493f29d441e654d740f308c31d9ac3f7443a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,209,73,63,41,212,65,230,84,215,64,243,8,195,29,154,195,247,68,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
