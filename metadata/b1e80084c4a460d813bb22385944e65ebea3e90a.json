Enjoy!\n\n400 Prophecies, Appearance or Foreshadowings of Christ in the Tanakh:\nThis message was delivered at Bethany Baptist Church of Advance, NC. The goal was to encourage faith in Messiah Jesus by referring to Old Testament passages -- many not very familiar -- that point to the resurrection of the Messiah -- as well as to His death. Interested persons may write to the preacher -- &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6818091d04001d050a0d1a281e0d1a0112070646060d1c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nThe first part of the Tanakh is a reference to the Law (Torah). There are 117 passages taken from the first five books of Moses pointing to the Messiah in that. The second part is a reference to the Writings (Ketuvim). There are 144 passages taken pointing to Christ in that section. The third part refers to the Prophets (Nevi'im). There are 153 passages pointing to Christ in that part. Putting the three leading letters togetherÃ¢â‚¬â€TNKÃ¢â‚¬â€gives an approximation for the word, Tanakh.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIs God the Author of Sin? Calvinism Destroyed with Jesse Morrell:\nThe content of this video comes from Jesse Morrell's book, &quot;The Natural Ability of Man: A Study on Free Will &amp; Human Nature&quot; sold through Biblical Truth Resources. http://biblicaltruthresources.wordpre...\n\nJohn Calvin taught that sin was the work of God. Just like Islam and paganism, Calvinism teaches that God is the author of sin. This full length video is a refutation to that blasphemous charge.\n\nJohn Calvin said, &quot;Whatever things are done wrongly and unjustly by man, these very things are the right and just works of God.&quot;\n\nMartin Luther said, &quot;Since, therefore, God moves and does all in all, He necessarily moves and does all in Satan and the wicked man...&quot;\n\nLuther also said, &quot;God worketh all things in all men even wickedness in the wicked&quot;\n\nOriginal uploader cooments:\nThis is Jesse Morrell speaking in the video. I think he did a GREAT job on this video, so I am sharing it with others. I hope it's a blessing to you like it has been for me but I am not saying I agree with everything Jesse has ever said before, or that I am a Jesse Morrell follower or anything that ridiculous or extreme. In fact there might be something he has said that I have not heard yet that I do disagree with. I am not 100% sure but that's beside the point folks. He might not agree with everything I say either. I don't openly endorse ANYBODY.\nIt's simple. This is a GREAT teaching so I'm sharing it with you. Eat the fish; spit out the bones.\n\nGod bless your studies...\nOF THE KJV BIBLE!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWas the Protestant Reformation Right? by Greg Bahnsen:\n&quot;The Road to Rome: Was the Reformation Right?&quot; Dr. Greg Bahnsen lectures on Martin Luther, his fight against the Roman Catholic Church, the topic of 'justification by faith alone', Galatians, and the 16th Century Protestant Reformation and its legacy.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore sermons included...\nTake A Stand\nFrom Sabbath &quot;Saturday&quot; to sunday\nThings That Can Not be Shaken\nWhen God Says No\nYou Suppress the Truth by Saying We All Sin - Tim Conway\n\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.
