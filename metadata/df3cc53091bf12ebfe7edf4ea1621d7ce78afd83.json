Part of the problem is that Harry Nilsson wrote some amazing songs in his time -- but he also wrote some that were not quite so amazing. Another part of the problem is that some of these songs don't lend themselves easily to interpretation -- thus we have Fred Schneider destroying &quot;Coconut&quot; with a loud, crunchy treatment, and LaVern Baker turning &quot;Jump into the Fire&quot; into a wimpy R&amp;B outing. On the other hand, &quot;Spaceman&quot; is even more interestingly quirky in the hands of the Roches and Mark Johnson, Aimee Mann brings out the sweet side of &quot;One,&quot; Adrian Belew does a fine &quot;Me and My Arrow,&quot; and Steve Forbert turns in a supremely cute take on &quot;The Moonbeam Song.&quot; Overall a nice project (with money going to the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence), though it does not replace the original Nilsson performances by a long chalk. \n\n For the Love of Harry: Everybody Sings Nilsson\n\n(CD - Musicmasters #65127) \n\nCD&gt;Wav&gt;Traders Little Helper&gt;Level 6 FLAC\n\nTrack Listings\n\n1.
