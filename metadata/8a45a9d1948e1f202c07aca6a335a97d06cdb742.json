Start with the soil, learn about itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world... http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8399807/Symphony_of_the_Soil\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœSymphony of the Soil,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a Salute to What Feeds Us New York Times, Published: October 10, 2013\nUnlike many recent documentaries about our careless stewardship of the planet, Deborah Koons GarciaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Symphony of the SoilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel like a rap on the knuckles. Unfolding with gentle joy and an unexpected beauty, this ode to the miracle of the EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s topmost layer gives us a newfound respect for the ground beneath our feet.\nFilming on four continents and with contributions from impassioned scientists, farmers and foodies, Ms. Garcia explains how dead dirt is transformed into living soil Ã¢â‚¬â€ and, perhaps more important, how many of our farming practices are effecting the reverse. But this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t simply another plea for sustainable agriculture and the rejection of herbicides; celebration, not disapproval, is Ms. GarciaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s default tone.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Times Square on New YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Eve all the time in the soil,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the soil biologist Dr. Elaine Ingham says enthusiastically, and, with the help of a microscope, we see exactly what she means. And when images of parched earth and desiccated corn make us anxious, we can luxuriate in the fabulous hair and poetic flourishes of the microbial ecologist Dr. Ignacio Chapela, whose crooning homage to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“dialogue of nutrientsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ between soil and water belongs on everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meditation mixtape.\nInfused with an infectious love for its subject, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Symphony of the SoilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ presents a wondrous world of critters and bacteria, mulch and manure. Maintaining this layer in all its richness and diversity is, the film argues, perhaps our most critical weapon against climate change. At the very least, you will leave with the profound understanding that feeding our soil is the first step in feeding ourselves. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/movies/symphony-of-the-soil-a-salute-to-what-&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/movies/symphony-of-the-soil-a-salute-to-what-&lt;/a&gt; feeds-us.html?_r=0\nhealth, food, gmo, agriculture, farming, diet, gardening, agriculture, biology\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a45a9d1948e1f202c07aca6a335a97d06cdb742","amp;dn":"Alicia+Silverstone+%26ndash%3B+How+To+Live+A+Kind+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a45a9d1948e1f202c07aca6a335a97d06cdb742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,69,169,209,148,142,31,32,44,7,172,166,163,53,169,125,6,205,183,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
