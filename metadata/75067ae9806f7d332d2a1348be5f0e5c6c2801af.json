Each album does contain the correct embedded album art (iTunes won't recognize the 2 arts but apps like Foobar will be true to the tags).\n\nIf you want to have these show up as 2 Albums, change Disc 1 title to Dead Presidents and Disc 2 title to Dead Presidents Vol II. Also change Disc tag to 1/1 for each volume. That will make it correct database tags.\n\n\n\nWhew, now that tag talk is done, despite the movie being so-so this is one of the best collections of funk soul music available on CD's. If you like the genre this is a must-have. I hope you enjoy.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nVA - Dead Presidents \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: Dead Presidents\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1995\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 266kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nVol I\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
