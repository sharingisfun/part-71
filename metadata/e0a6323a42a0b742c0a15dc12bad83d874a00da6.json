Julian shared his enormous knowledge of the world's best art with a panache that is irresistible.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Justice Stephen Goudge, Ontario Court of Appeal\n\nThis essential companion to all the major European museums and galleries discusses some of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest paintings from Giotto through to Picasso. Julian PorterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passion for art began with the seven years he spent as a student tour guide in Europe. Since then, he has conducted countless tours of EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famous galleries Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Louvre, The Prado, The Hermitage, The Rijksmuseum, the Sistine Chapel, and many others.\n\nIn the usually pretentious arena of art connoisseurs, PorterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice stands out as fresh and original. He finds the best of the best, which he describes with entertaining irreverence, and spares you hours of sore feet and superfluous information.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0a6323a42a0b742c0a15dc12bad83d874a00da6","amp;dn":"149+Paintings+You+Really+Need+to+See+in+Europe%3A+%28So+You+Can+Igno","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0a6323a42a0b742c0a15dc12bad83d874a00da6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,166,50,58,66,160,183,66,192,161,93,193,43,173,131,216,116,160,13,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
