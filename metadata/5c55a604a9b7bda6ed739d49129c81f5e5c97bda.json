Vietnam, desegregation, Watergate, and more are presented from the perspective of Tom Hanks's loveably slow-witted Forrest Gump as he finds himself embroiled in situations he can't quite comprehend. Hanks leads an excellent cast, featuring Robin Wright Penn as Jenny, Forrest's lifelong love; Gary Sinise as the irascible Lt. Dan, his Vietnam superior; Mykelti Williamson as Bubba, a shrimp- loving soldier; and Sally Fields as his devoted mother. Robert Zemeckis's emotional, heartwarming film garnered 13 Academy Award nominations and six wins, including Best Picture, Director, Actor--Tom Hanks, and Adapted Screenplay.\n\nFrench: Dolby Digital 5.1 (640 kbps)\n\n23,976 fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c55a604a9b7bda6ed739d49129c81f5e5c97bda","amp;dn":"Forrest.Gump.1994.French.AC3.Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c55a604a9b7bda6ed739d49129c81f5e5c97bda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,85,166,4,169,183,189,166,237,115,157,73,18,156,129,245,229,201,123,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
