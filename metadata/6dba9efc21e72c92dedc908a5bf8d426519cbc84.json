Mark Lewisohn uses his unprecedented archival access and hundreds of new interviews to construct the full story of the lives and work of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr.\nTen years in the making, Tune In takes the Beatles from before their childhoods through the final hour of 1962 - when, with breakthrough success just days away, they stand on the cusp of a whole new kind of fame and celebrity. They've one hit record (&quot;Love Me Do&quot;) behind them and the next (&quot;Please Please Me&quot;) primed for release, their first album session is booked, and America is clear on the horizon. This is the lesser-known Beatles story - the pre-Fab years of Liverpool and Hamburg - and in many respects the most absorbing and incredible period of them all. Here is the complete and true account of their family lives, childhoods, teenage years, and their infatuation with American music; here is the riveting narrative of their unforgettable days and nights in the Cavern Club, their laughs, larks, and adventures when they could move about freely, before fame closed in.\nFor those who've never read a Beatles book before, this is the place to discover the young men behind the icons. For those who think they know John, Paul, George, and Ringo, it's time to press the reset button and tune into the real story, the lasting word.\n\nWritten by: Mark Lewisohn\nNarrated by: Clive Mantle\nLength: 43 hrs and 48 mins \nFormat: Unabridged\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dba9efc21e72c92dedc908a5bf8d426519cbc84","amp;dn":"Mark+Lewisohn+-+Tune+In%3A+The+Beatles%3A+All+These+Years","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dba9efc21e72c92dedc908a5bf8d426519cbc84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,186,158,252,33,231,44,146,222,220,144,138,91,248,212,38,81,156,188,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
