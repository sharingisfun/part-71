If you slide over the icons, they are animated a little bit mac-like ... just try it!\n\nAdditional features in the full version:\n\ncustom icons for the icon on the homescreen\nsupport for ADW icon packs for the icon on the homescreen\nvertical and horizontal launcher versions\nSome icons in the screenshots are from 'CircleLauncher IconPack One' and the wallpaper is 'wp clock full'.\n\nThere is an issue with Android 3.x (and higher): Some devices need a restart (or wait a few hours) until the new installed widget appears in the widget list. But at the moment, I don't know the reason ...\n\nFacebook-User, please read: Restricted contacts are created by the Facebook sync adapter. These contacts are accessible to a whitelist of applications, which is specified and enforced by Facebook. The restricted contact API is private, which means that nobody (with the exception of Facebook) should be using it at this point. So the only way to get the pictures from your Facebook contacts is to use another tool to synchronize. I would suggest to use 'SyncMyPix', please try it!\n\n\nWHATS NEW;\n\n* minor bug fixes\n\nPLEASE SEED AS LLONG AS POSSIBLE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b963642edec9f758d497b1d15bea64d8a523771d","amp;dn":"CircleLauncher+v3.1.1%28AnDrOid%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b963642edec9f758d497b1d15bea64d8a523771d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,99,100,46,222,201,247,88,212,151,177,209,91,234,100,216,165,35,119,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
