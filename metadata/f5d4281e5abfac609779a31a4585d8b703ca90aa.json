Fats plays trumpet on all tracks (this is\n\na memorial album after all)\n\n\n\n\nDexter's ultimate sound was still a work in progress here...he uses quite a bit more\n\nvibrato and has a Ben Websterish quality at times.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5d4281e5abfac609779a31a4585d8b703ca90aa","amp;dn":"Fats+Navarro+%2F+Memorial+II+%2F+Rouse%2CDexter%2CDameron%2CLockjaw+%2F+1947","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5d4281e5abfac609779a31a4585d8b703ca90aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,212,40,30,90,191,172,96,151,121,163,26,69,133,216,183,3,202,144,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
