Urban infrastructure is controlled and operated by a complex system. \n\nIn Watch_DogsChikago submits Central Operating System (ctOS), namely it contains information on all residents. \nAnd anyone who gets access to it, would gain control over the city. \n\nAiden Pierce - a prominent hacker with a criminal record, whose actions have caused the tragedy. \nTo avenge his family, he goes on the warpath - and you with it. Aiden is able to hack and use \nanything that is connected to the city information network - all that surrounds it. Access to \nsecurity cameras, loading personal data, tracking the location of people, control traffic lights \nand public transport ... \n\nChicago itself becomes your weapon. You just need to learn how to use it.\n\n\nFeatures\nHacked CITY \n\nWatch_Dogs events occur in carefully recreated Chicago, whose life can be controlled by the usual smartphone. \nSwitch the lights to the pursuers are stuck in traffic.

On top of the picture you'll have a more than 30 weapons. \n\nRace at high speed \n\nIn working on the game participated studio Ubisoft Reflection - creators of the series Driver. Chicago \ncan move on driving more than 65 various vehicles. Each of them is carefully modeled and behaves \non the road most authentic. \n\nEverything is under control \n\nAt the core lies Watch_Dogs brand new, specially designed technology. You will enjoy incredible \ngraphics and authentic realism, your actions will affect the course of history and human life, \nand the consequences of decisions will diverge in a virtual world like ripples in the water. \n\nFREEDOM OF MOVEMENT \n\nIn Watch_Dogs you can not only use the city's operating system for their own benefit, \nbut also the street themselves. Cuts through the building or climb onto the roof to \nhunt down the target. \n\n&quot;Seamless&quot; MULTIPLAYER \n\nNew level of interaction, cooperation and confrontation is achieved thanks to a new system \nof organization multiplayer combining single-and multiplayer game together.
