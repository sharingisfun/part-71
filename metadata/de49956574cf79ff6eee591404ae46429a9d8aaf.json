From those basic parameters, gaming professionals manage to create the enormous variety of games on the market today. The Handbook of Digital Games explores the many considerations and variables involved in game creation, including gaming techniques and tools, game play, and game design and development.\n\nA team of recognized gaming experts from around the world shares their thoughts on the different aspects of game creation, providing readers with a deep understanding and insider perspective on the cross-disciplinary aspects of the industry. The fundamentals are discussed, but the emphasis is on emerging theory and technology with topics including:\n\nPlayer experience and immersion, including emotion\nAutomatic content generation and storytelling techniques\nCollaboration and social information exchange\nGame aesthetics\nSimulation of game play and crowds\nCollision detection\nNetworking issues such as synchronization\n\nThe book also includes retrospective and ontological examinations of gaming, as well as discussions about mobile game play, spatial game structures, and education-centric gaming. In-game advertising, gender stereotyping, and independent game production are also considered. The Handbook of Digital Games is a robust compilation of the latest information across the entire industry, and a major resource for any gaming professional.\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de49956574cf79ff6eee591404ae46429a9d8aaf","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Digital+Games+%28Wiley%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de49956574cf79ff6eee591404ae46429a9d8aaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,73,149,101,116,207,121,255,110,238,89,20,4,174,70,66,154,157,138,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
