One exemple is the song &quot;Ouro de Tolo&quot; (Fool's gold) which was a pre-RAP. This didn't exist back then.\n\nMusic was the trigger for me to start learning english. If you feel like doing the same towards portuguese, try translating this song first.\n\nRgds,","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f6adfd4843551ed40082bacbc7a00eba79c44bd","amp;dn":"Raul+Seixas+-+O+Filme+-+O+In%26iacute%3Bcio%2C+o+Fim+e+o+Meio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f6adfd4843551ed40082bacbc7a00eba79c44bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,106,223,212,132,53,81,237,64,8,43,172,188,122,0,235,167,156,68,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
