The new full-length bluegrass album &quot;Pennsylvania Coal&quot; is a tribute to her coal-mining grandfather and is a recording that Irene has had on her bucket list for a some time. Produced by GRAMMY winner Mark Fain, the album features many contemporary roots music giants such as Carl Jackson, Rhonda Vincent, Claire Lynch, Dale Ann Bradley, Darren Vincent, Stuart Duncan, Bryan Sutton, Trisha Yearwood, and others. Recorded at Middletree Studios in East Nashville, the CD highlights Picott's particular gift for exploring complex themes in common language.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cafa3f0d80be7f78ed0f002ab37a859f2cfed34f","amp;dn":"Irene+Kelley+-+Pennsylvania+Coal+%282014%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cafa3f0d80be7f78ed0f002ab37a859f2cfed34f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,250,63,13,128,190,127,120,237,15,0,42,179,122,133,159,44,254,211,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
