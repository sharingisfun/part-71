We depend on high-tech novelties of the \nmarket, because only through them know what is happening in the world. \nBut progress is a dark side. Our every action leaves a trace: every move,\nevery stop, everything we like or dislike. And it's not just us. Megacities \nenmeshed in digital networks. Urban infrastructure is controlled and operated \nby a complex system. Chicago submits Central Operating System (ctOS), namely \nit contains information on all residents. And anyone who gets access to it, \nwould gain control over the city.\n\nAiden Pierce - a prominent hacker with a criminal record, whose actions have \ncaused the tragedy. To avenge his family, he goes on the warpath - and you \nwith it. Aiden is able to hack and use anything that is connected to the city \ninformation network - all that surrounds it. Access to security cameras, loading \npersonal data, tracking the location of people, control traffic lights and public \ntransport ... Chicago itself becomes your weapon. You just need to learn how \nto use it.\nFeatures:\n\n* Events Watch_Dogs occur in carefully recreated Chicago, whose life can be \ncontrolled by the usual smartphone. Switch the lights to the pursuers are stuck \nin traffic. Hold the departing train and jump into it to break away from the \nchase. Dilute bridges to close the door. In a city where everything is connected, \nCentral Operating System will be your assistant. \n* Take advantage of not only central to the operating system, but also the \ncity streets themselves. In the virtual Chicago you can take a shortcut \nthrough the building or climb onto the roof to ambush prey. \n* In Chicago, their laws. Here to meet violence with violence, and you have \nenough strength and skill to adopt rules. Melee and shooting real as ever - \nrealistic physics games give odds to many representatives of the genre. \nAt your disposal will be more than 30 weapons. \nIn the work on the game participated studio Ubisoft Reflection - \ncreators of the series Driver. Chicago can move on driving more than \n65 various vehicles. Each of them is carefully modeled and behaves \non the road most authentic. \n* The basis Watch_Dogs is brand new, specially developed technology. \nYou will enjoy incredible graphics and authentic realism, your actions will \naffect the course of history and human life, and the consequences of \ndecisions will diverge in a virtual world like ripples in the water.\n\nLaunch\n* Copy any place game \n* Play with ...  bin  Watch_Dogs_3dm.exe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d2008e539954438cd51241a6dc05c569362b87a","amp;dn":"Watch.Dogs.Deluxe.Edition.%5BP%5D-3DM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d2008e539954438cd51241a6dc05c569362b87a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,32,8,229,57,149,68,56,205,81,36,26,109,192,92,86,147,98,184,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
