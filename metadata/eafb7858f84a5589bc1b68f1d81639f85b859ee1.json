Yet as Adeed Dawisha shows in this superb political history, the story of a fragile and socially fractured Iraq did not begin with the invasion--it is as old as Iraq itself.\nDawisha traces the history of the Iraqi state from its inception in 1921 following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and up to the present day. He demonstrates how from the very beginning Iraq's ruling elites sought to unify this ethnically diverse and politically explosive society by developing state governance, fostering democratic institutions, and forging a national identity. Dawisha, who was born and raised in Iraq, gives rare insight into this culturally rich but chronically divided nation, drawing on a wealth of Arabic and Western sources to describe the fortunes and calamities of a state that was assembled by the British in the wake of World War I and which today faces what may be the most serious threat to survival that it has ever known.\nIraq is required reading for anyone seeking to make sense of what's going on in Iraq today, and why it has been so difficult to create a viable government there.\n\n===================================================================================\nEditorial Review\nFrom Booklist\nIn the spring of 2003, at the onset of the invasion of Iraq, Dawisha (Arab Nationalism in the Twentieth Century, 2003) coauthored an article in Foreign Affairs in which he suggested, with cautious optimism, that building democracy in his native country might not be as difficult as some critics of the war were then warning. Six years later, his concern is not whether Iraq will bloom as a democracy but whether Iraq as a unified national entity and sovereign member of the international community will even continue to exist. The challenge, he argues, is and has always been Ã¢â‚¬Å“ethnosectarianism,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a product of IraqÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s geographically and demographically diverse population. From King Faysal in the 1920s through the rule of Saddam Hussein, powerful central government, nationalist ideology, and brute force more or less successfully contained IraqÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s internal centrifugal forces. Such diversity could be fertile ground for democracy, but since 2003, the flames of sectarian conflict have been fanned by the stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inability to effectively neutralize threats to its power, and by a political system that cultivated, rather than managed, sectarian strife. More scholarly in tone than most recent works asking what went wrong in Iraq, DawishaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s historical perspective also sets his account apart. --Brendan Driscoll\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;Anyone who thinks that Iraq has no history of democratic government needs to read this book immediately.&quot;--Choice\n\n&quot;We are fortunate to have scholars, such as Adeed Dawisha, who continue to grapple with Iraqs political complexities. . . . A highly accessible and insightful work on one of the most important and complex countries in the Middle East.&quot;--Eric Davis, Middle East Journal\n\n&quot;Dawisha's . . . reliance on the many memoirs, monographs, and histories written by Iraqis themselves, plus his own intimate knowledge of Iraq in its domestic, regional, and international setting, makes for a fine (if disheartening) study of abortive state building.&quot;--L. Carl Brown, Foreign Affairs\n\n&quot;Dawisha has only the worst superlatives for Saddams tyrannical regime. . . . And yet we should not give up on Iraq, for Dawisha doesnt. He never loses his calm or objectivity.&quot;--Robert D. Kaplan, National Interest\n\n&quot;This book should be required reading for all those involved in building a brighter future for Iraq.&quot;--Alison Webster, European Legacy\n\n&quot;Adeed Dawisha's well-written and flowing book makes an important contribution to understanding the complex history of Iraq. . . . Dawisha's approach indeed provides a multidimensional, complex, and nuanced picture of the development of Iraq. . . . Dawisha's important book is recommended for anyone who is interested in the comprehensive view of Iraqi history or for anyone who is interested in Middle Eastern affairs and history.&quot;--Michael Eppel, Historian\n\n===================================================================================\nFrom the Back Cover\n&quot;Adeed Dawisha has written a deeply informed study of the history of the Iraqi state. This is a book to be read by all who care about Iraqs future.&quot;--William B. Quandt, University of Virginia\n\n&quot;A pleasure to read. This book is a major contribution by a scholar who has written extensively on Arab nationalism and Iraq and knows the subject well. It is grounded in thorough research, good judgment formed by working on Iraq over a long period of time, and excellent analysis of Iraqs governing institutions and their relation to society over time.&quot;--Phebe Marr, author of The Modern History of Iraq\n\n&quot;A new and useful approach that provides a birds-eye view of Iraqi history mainly through three lenses: building a governing structure, molding a national identity, and legitimizing the state and the ruling elites through democratic institutions. Dawisha helps readers to better understand what went wrong in Iraq, why, and what are the roots of the present crisis.&quot;--Amatzia Baram, University of Haifa\n--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nAdeed Dawisha is distinguished professor of political science at Miami University in Ohio. His books include &quot;Arab Nationalism in the Twentieth Century&quot; (Princeton), &quot;Syria and the Lebanese Crisis&quot;, and &quot;Egypt in the Arab World&quot;.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eafb7858f84a5589bc1b68f1d81639f85b859ee1","amp;dn":"Adeed+Dawisha+-+Iraq.+A+Political+History+from+Independence+to+O","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eafb7858f84a5589bc1b68f1d81639f85b859ee1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,251,120,88,248,74,85,137,188,27,104,241,216,22,57,248,91,133,158,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
