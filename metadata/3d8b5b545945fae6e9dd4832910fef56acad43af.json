They all utilize geometry. Geometry is Professor Mary Pyo's favorite subject and she brings her excitement when she focuses on student problem areas such as proofs. Mary begins each lesson with fundamental concepts and reinforces them with many examples. Additional topics include Inductive/Deductive Reasoning, Congruency, Proportions, and Transformational Geometry. Professor Pyo received her MasterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in Educational Curriculum and Instruction, her specialized credentials in Foundational mathematics, and has been teaching for over 10 years.\n\nTotal length - 58:08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d8b5b545945fae6e9dd4832910fef56acad43af","amp;dn":"Educator.com+-+Geometry+with+Mary+Pyo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d8b5b545945fae6e9dd4832910fef56acad43af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,139,91,84,89,69,250,230,233,221,72,50,145,15,239,86,172,173,67,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
