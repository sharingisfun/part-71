Just glance at a few titles included on the greatest-hits collection Pure Cult: The Singles 1984-1995: &quot;Edie (Ciao Baby),&quot; &quot;Love Removal Machine,&quot; &quot;She Sells Sanctuary,&quot; &quot;Wild Flower,&quot; &quot;Fire Woman,&quot; &quot;Rain,&quot; &quot;Lil' Devil&quot; -- you get the picture. Spread haphazardly across the disc (rather than in chronological order), each track's uniqueness is even more evident, further showcasing the Cult's fearless creativity. Early songs such as &quot;Spiritwalker&quot; and &quot;Resurrection Joe&quot; will surprise most fans with their class and maturity, while later cuts like &quot;Wild Hearted Son,&quot; &quot;Heart of Soul,&quot; and &quot;Coming Down&quot; (from their disappointing latter-day albums) are given new life when viewed on their own merits. Boasting almost identical track selection to another Pure Cult collection (including a few rare outtakes) of a few years earlier, this one's merely a tad more career-spanning complete, but the small differences aren't worth stressing over.\nAll Music Review by Eduardo Rivadavia\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] She Sells Sanctuary\n[02] Fire Woman\n[03] Lil' Devil\n[04] Spiritwalker\n[05] The Witch\n[06] Revolution\n[07] Love Removal Machine\n[08] Rain\n[09] In The Clouds\n[10] Coming Down\n[11] Edie (Ciao Baby)\n[12] Heart Of Soul\n[13] Wild Flower\n[14] Star\n[15] Resurrection Joe\n[16] Go West\n[17] Sun King\n[18] Wild Hearted Son\n[19] Sweet Soul Sister\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:17m:30s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 194mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
