Famitsu revealed that the battle system featured four party members, and was more team-oriented. The game also features more of a sci-fi emphasis than past titles with the ability to control your own ship. This ship is quite large, and is able to land on at least 5 planets or other space-based destinations. Players are able to travel through the &quot;star ocean,&quot; jumping across planets.[8] The game takes place a few centuries before the original Star Ocean (around S.D. 10, or approximately 2087 AD).[9] The game's plot revolves around Edge and his crew combating a mysterious threat called the &quot;Grigori&quot;.\n\nAn international version of the game was released by Square Enix as a worldwide PlayStation 3-exclusive on February 9, 2010.[5] Officially known as Star Ocean: The Last Hope International, the game contains both Japanese and English voices as well as new content that is exclusive to the international version of the game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06d6c06c54df51a1cdb104e4235b822011a3b823","amp;dn":"Star+Ocean+The+Last+Hope+%28j-TAG%2FRGH+ONLY%29+xbox360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06d6c06c54df51a1cdb104e4235b822011a3b823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,214,192,108,84,223,81,161,205,177,4,228,35,91,130,32,17,163,184,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
