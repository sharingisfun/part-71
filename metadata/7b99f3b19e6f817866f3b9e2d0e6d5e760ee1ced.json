Halbig, a former Florida State Trooper and Executive Director of the National Institute for School and Workplace Safety. Earlier this month, Halbig addressed a meeting of the Connecticut Board of Education about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and the coordinated shutdown of public information concerning the incident as skeptics seek answers on a number of inconsistencies and anomalies. \n\nAlex also talks with director and writer Joel Gilbert. His most recent project is Dreams from My Real Father: A Story of Reds and Deception, a film that states Obama's real father was Chicago Marxist Frank Marshall Davis. Gilbert also wrote, produced and directed Atomic Jihad: Ahmadinejad's Coming War For Islamic Revival And Obama's Politics.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
