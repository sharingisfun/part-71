Martin series A Song of Ice and Fire. This 3 hour movie has been edited together with footage from the HBO series Game of Thrones.\n\n&quot;You can now watch the entire first season as a movie with all of the unnecessary filler cut. Daenerys and Jon do suffer from this by having very little of them in it, mainly for time as the film is Lord of the Rings length, but their stuff has merely been moved to the second film, Clash of Kings.&quot;\n\nGood for GoT fans. Those who haven't seen any episode of GoT can immediately be a fan of the show in just 3 hours.\n\nSome frames just move slightly slower but other than that it's a good edit.\n\nP.S. If anyone would be willing to make English subtitle for it, that would be appreciated so much.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9db408015a68c0216e3ba1426634158316a3b42","amp;dn":"Game+of+Thrones+Fan+Edit.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9db408015a68c0216e3ba1426634158316a3b42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,219,64,128,21,166,140,2,22,227,186,20,38,99,65,88,49,106,59,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
