The initial download site is: \n\n\n\n Mirror sites(ally)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shino.pos.to/party/bridge.cgi?puppy/lupu/test/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shino.pos.to/party/bridge.cgi?puppy/lupu/test/&lt;/a&gt; (shinobar)\n\n\n The set of ISO files of identical function, different only in their internal structure. All were created with the &quot;remaster&quot; tool.- The main lupu has everything in the main (lupu_528) SFS file. \n\n md5sum: 273f93b0a59236be2f1ce04dd2056786 \n\n - lupulibre has LibreOffice and java/jre included in the large main file, to load into RAM if 1 GB of RAM is installed. \n\n md5sum: f352deb2a8a1d001745eb82e0d1b8258 \n\n - lupumini has a &quot;zdrv&quot; SFS file so that the main file fits into 256 MB of RAM. \n\n md5sum: 14c0aa410fb07180dcfd1bb8872390f9 \n\n - lupuplus is lupumini with added SFS files such as LibreOffice, java runtime (jre), devx and kernel source to be copied to a frugal installation directory. \n\n md5sum: ccc75a2d15c7ced5fb2325d09add9e6c \n\n - lupu3hd (3-Headed Dog) is lupu based on linux kernel 2.6.37.6, to support somewhat newer hardware than does the lupu kernel (2.6.33.2). \n\n md5sum: 19110e9154d70110ea1fcc681a56afb9 \n\n - lupusuper (or &quot;sulu&quot;) is/are based on kernels 3.x, to support newer hardware and xz compression. \n\n md5sum: 9efcd0c06648269dd7d058f252650a1c \n\n(kernel from precise 5.7.1, which includes analog modem support) \n md5sum: 4c150ef6a3988d2d9ad950d929140ec1 \n\n(kernel from pemasu's dpup wheezy) \n md5sum: d35cadf89cab0cf6cd7df2050fa34222 \n\n(kernel from pemasu's upup raring) \n md5sum: 88746e6c275cfdbef75d984fa8a2e53f\nThe main ISO files will be updated together and will have the same date-tag in their names. &quot;3hd&quot; and &quot;super&quot; may have later date-tags because they may be updated more frequently, due to their being considered experimental. They provide the full lupu capabilities to newer hardware, but with some risk of incompatibilities with the newer kernels used. \n\n Note that Lucid Pup is not released in the same manner as other puppy projects. The version level is frozen at &quot;5.2.8&quot;, so that all puppy-main files are named &quot;lupu_528&quot; and will not trigger the normal pupsave-update function. To manage the cases where a pet package has been installed and becomes part of a later upgrade of lupu, after replacement of the main files in a frugal installation and subsequent boot-up, a check is made for packages now included in the main (lupu_528) file. If a conflict is found, a (pop-up) recommendation is made to uninstall the conflicting package, so as to utilize the new version in lupu. \n\n This effort is endorsed by the originator of Lucid Pup, playdayz, who has committed to maintain the QuickPet aspect of lucid support and advise me in maintaining the core of Lucid Pup. A big &quot;thank you&quot;, playdayz! \n\n The history of the upgrades made to lupu528-005 to create 5.2.8.6 is here:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=726108#726108&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=726108#726108&lt;/a&gt; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b6fc3fec47b0ef1f7348f80ce7216db8e95c3e1","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_Lupu_5.2.8.6_2014_01_09_archive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b6fc3fec47b0ef1f7348f80ce7216db8e95c3e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,111,195,254,196,123,14,241,247,52,143,128,206,114,22,219,142,149,195,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
