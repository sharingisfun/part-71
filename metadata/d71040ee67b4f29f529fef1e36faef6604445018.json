I put this on the left to get them in chronological order, plus you can use it to construct the upload page URL directly.\n\nSecond snippet: Date per torrent name. Ordinary dates refer to Weeklies, while those with a 00 in the day or month positions refer to Monthlies or Annuals, respectively.\n\nThird snippet:  Type of torrent. In order, 0D(ay) or H(it)L(ist), part number, and revision (1 for the regulars, 2 for &quot;fixes&quot;, &quot;repacks&quot;, &quot;fillers&quot;, and so forth).\n\nFourth snippet: Initial letters of first and last files contained. Occasionally meaningless when torrent wasn't alphabetized, but quite useful otherwise, I'd say.\n\n---\n\nAny mistakes made in the original titles are (deliberately) preserved here, so trust the first and last tokens rather than the ones in the middle, whenever in doubt. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d71040ee67b4f29f529fef1e36faef6604445018","amp;dn":"ComicPirates+Weeklies+%282012.04+-+2014.04%29s.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d71040ee67b4f29f529fef1e36faef6604445018","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,16,64,238,103,180,242,159,82,159,239,30,54,250,239,102,4,68,80,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
