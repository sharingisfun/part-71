Parker, whose getaway car crashes after a heist, manages to elude capture with his loot by breaking into an amusement park that is closed for the winter. But his presence does not go unnoticed-a pair of cops observed the job and its aftermath. But rather than pursue their suspect... they decide to go into business for themselves, with the help of some &quot;business associates.&quot; From then on it's a game of cat and mouse, one played out through closed rides of the abandoned carnival... a game that slowly starts to favor the mouse.\n\nEnjoy and please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7689bf43408c4a368292353bea07fb61be3e93e7","amp;dn":"Parker+Vol.+4+Slayground+%28phillywilly%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7689bf43408c4a368292353bea07fb61be3e93e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,137,191,67,64,140,74,54,130,146,53,59,234,7,251,97,190,62,147,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
