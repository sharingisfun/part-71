It fully emulates TI-84+, TI-84+ Silver Edition, TI-83+, TI-83+ Silver Edition, TI-73, TI-83, TI-85, TI-86, TI-82, and TI-81 calculators made by Texas Instruments. And yes, if you have got a tablet, it will become a really BIG TI calculator. AlmostTI also lets you save your calculations at any point and then select from several previously saved tasks.\n\nTo run AlmostTI, you will need at least one calculator system ROM. AlmostTI does not include any calculator ROMs on its own, as they are intellectual property of Texas Instruments. You should place your own ROM, preferably dumped from the calculator you own, onto your internal storage. AlmostTI recognizes following ROM files (in upper or lower case):\n\nTI85.ROM, TI86.ROM, TI81.ROM, TI82.ROM, TI73.ROM, TI83.ROM, TI83P.ROM, TI83SE.ROM, TI84P.ROM, TI84SE.ROM\n\nTI-85.ROM, TI-86.ROM, TI-81.ROM, TI-82.ROM, TI-73.ROM, TI-83.ROM, TI-83P.ROM, TI-83SE.ROM, TI-84P.ROM, TI-84SE.ROM\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fms.ati&amp;hl=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fms.ati&amp;hl=en&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n* DISABLED forced updates\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bab81153b097819d7b831a798e4ea10a55044b5","amp;dn":"AlmostTI-2.3.5-CRACKED.apk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bab81153b097819d7b831a798e4ea10a55044b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,171,129,21,59,9,120,25,215,184,49,167,152,228,234,16,165,80,68,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
