This torrent contains all chapters from Prologue to the 10th Anniversary chapter. It also contains the Two Kinds World Map from deviantART, and Tom Fischbach's Profile Drawing. Each chapter has been compiled into PDF files that are conveniently small in Byte size but still good in quality. Exactly 779 pages, and 19 chapters (including prologue, 10th anniversary, and part 1 &amp; 2 of chapter 6). If you want to read the comic (That is still ongoing) I recommend going to the actual site ( http://twokinds.keenspot.com ). I only uploaded this torrent for people who are either too lazy to click page after page of the website on their computer, or want to read on their ebook devices (like me). This is my first torrent upload, so please be gentle; I spent 3 hours downloading each comic page one at a time, and placing them in their appropriate chapters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6d2ae8b09d3cbc50cc5921aa0c06b71d000faea","amp;dn":"Two+Kinds+Prologue-10th+Anniversary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6d2ae8b09d3cbc50cc5921aa0c06b71d000faea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,210,174,139,9,211,203,197,12,197,146,26,160,192,107,113,208,0,250,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
