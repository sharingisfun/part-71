There stand several significant factors surrounding this record - it contained the band's last two singles to reach the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, with &quot;We Two&quot; reaching #22 and &quot;You're Driving Me out of My Mind&quot; peaking at #35.[citation needed]. &quot; The Net &quot; was also the first full studio release to feature John Farnham as new lead vocalist replacing Glenn Shorrock and Stephen Housden taking up the mantle of lead guitarist - it is also the last album featuring Original Members Beeb Birtles (who permanently left the lineup after the U.S Tour in support of the release) and Derek Pellicci who would rejoin the band in 1987.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dce4e71eb372f613150bdfab205dd29ecdd9064e","amp;dn":"Little+River+Band+-+The+Net","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dce4e71eb372f613150bdfab205dd29ecdd9064e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,228,231,30,179,114,246,19,21,11,223,171,32,93,210,158,205,217,6,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
