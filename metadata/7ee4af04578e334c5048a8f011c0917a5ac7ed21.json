He compares it to past examples: Lysenkoism in the Soviet Union, and the eugenics movement.\n\nLindzen describes the Iron Triangle and the Iron Rice Bowl, in which ambiguous statements by scientists are translated into alarmist statements by media and advocacy groups, influencing politicians to feed more money to the acquiescent scientists.\n\nIn consequence, he writes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“A profound dumbing down of the discussionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦interacts with the ascendancy of incompetents.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Prizes and accolades are awarded for politically correct statements, even if they defy logic. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Unfortunately, this also often induces better scientists to join the pack in order to preserve their status,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Lindzen adds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ee4af04578e334c5048a8f011c0917a5ac7ed21","amp;dn":"%5B2013%5D+Science+in+the+Public+Square+-+Global+Global+Climate+Alar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ee4af04578e334c5048a8f011c0917a5ac7ed21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,228,175,4,87,142,51,76,80,72,168,240,17,192,145,122,90,199,237,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
