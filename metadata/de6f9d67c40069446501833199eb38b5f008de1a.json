A life spent in silent pain has led Elektra to the precipice of despair. As she prepares to shed her past and take her next step, everything you know about her will change! Death is no escape, but she will find her way as a new option opens up that will take Elektra to places no other Marvel character can go.\n\n\nThanks goes to Tarutaru and theProletariat for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de6f9d67c40069446501833199eb38b5f008de1a","amp;dn":"Elektra+01+%282014%29+%281440%2B2048px-HD%29+%28TaruTariat-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de6f9d67c40069446501833199eb38b5f008de1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,111,157,103,196,0,105,68,101,1,131,49,153,235,56,181,240,8,222,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
