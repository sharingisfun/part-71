Their\nmusic is as free as the wind, wild, fierce, agonizing, but also strong,\ncoherent, sensitive, with all four musicians sharing the same vision and sense\nof focus. The band consists of Arthur Brooks on trumpet, Heinz Geisser on\ndrums, Mark Hennen on piano and William Parker on bass. Brooks is the\nreplacement of trombonist Jeff Hoyer, who had been with the band since its\ncreation, and who died in December 2006. I am sure his memory was with the\nmusicians when playing this album. I cannot compare with their previous work,\nbut the music that is to be heard on this album is breathtaking. The first\ntrack starts slowly, contemplatively, building up an edifice out of sparse\nnotes, somewhat reminiscent of Other Dimensions In Music, but as the piece\nevolves, momentum builds up, leading to the second piece, that has this\nincredible drive, propulsed forward by the rhythm section but especially by\nHennen's piano, whose relentless thundering is as energetic as it gets, with\nBrooks filling in perfectly on trumpet, adding the emotional voice, the shade\nand the color to the rest of the band. Throughout this musical tidal wave,\nmelodic lines come and go, are picked up by some band members, then replaced by\nothers, new forms arise, played with, transformed and replaced again. The storm\nalso subsides at moments, leaving room for a slight breeze, with subtle\nphrasing and interaction, yet no less intelligent, with the four instruments\ninterlocked while keeping the music open. And that's how the album ends, in a\nslow, abstract intense piece, full of calm and tension, alternating meditation\nwith more power-driven moments, but all within the same open framework. A\nwonderful feat, and a beautiful one.\n\n--\n\nBy Clifford Allen &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=34104&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=34104&lt;/a&gt;\n\nKatarzyna Misiaczyk (pl) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.diapazon.pl/PelnaWiadomosc.php?bn=Recenzje&amp;Id=2025&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.diapazon.pl/PelnaWiadomosc.php?bn=Recenzje&amp;Id=2025&lt;/a&gt;\n\ngrisli (fr) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://grisli.canalblog.com/archives/2009/03/03/12781065.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://grisli.canalblog.com/archives/2009/03/03/12781065.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ea633d1e35fcda8cab1471b3600be6016197f16","amp;dn":"Collective+4tet+-+In+Transition+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ea633d1e35fcda8cab1471b3600be6016197f16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,166,51,209,227,95,205,168,202,177,71,27,54,0,190,96,22,25,127,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
