THIS IS THE NEW TORRENT OF THAT SAME FILE AND THAT TORRENT WILL NO LONGER BE SEEDED. THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST 15 I EVER TORRENTED. I'M JUST CHANGING THE NAME SO ALL SHOW TITTLES ARE FORMATTTED ALIKE.\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. Some are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\nIn this broadcast:\n\nJimmy Buffett has a new song called &quot;Margaritaville.&quot;\n\nUndercover Angel is the fastest mover on the chart, on its way for a one week stay at number one.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;Which hit by an American group made it quickest to number one?&quot; It's a good story.\n\nSorry for the lame extra. I've got people looking into it.\n\nCasey explains what only Sylvester Stallone has in common with Charlie Chaplin and Orson Wells.\n\nKenny Rogers is on the chart with his first solo hit.\n\n40:    Slowdown Ã¢â‚¬â€œ John Miles\n39:    Jet Airliner Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Steve Miller Band\n38:    Back In The Saddle - Aerosmith        \n37:    Mainstreet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bob Seger     \n36:    Slow Dancin' Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Addrisi Brothers     \n35:    Love's Grown Deep Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kenny Nolan    \n34:    Cinderella - Firefall\n33:    Margaritaville Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jimmy Buffett\n32:    My Sweet Lady Ã¢â‚¬â€œ John Denver\n31:    Don't Give Up On Us Ã¢â‚¬â€œ David Soul\n30:    Uptown Festival (Part 1) - Shalamar\n29:    Show You The Way To Go Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Jacksons    \n28:    Undercover Angel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Alan O'Day\n27:    Your Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mccoo &amp; Davis\n26:    Whodunit - Tavares\n25:    Heard It In A Love Song Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Marshall Tucker Band\n24:    Don't Leave Me This Way Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Thelma Houston\n23:    Dancin' Man - Q\n22:    Ain't Gonna Bump No More Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Joe Tex\n21:    Gonna Fly Now Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bill Conti\n20:    Angel In Your Eyes - Hot\n19:    Feels Like The First Time - Foreigner\n18:    I've Got Love On My Mind Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Natalie Cole\n17:    Hello Stranger Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Yvonne Elliman\n16:    Calling Dr. Love - Kiss\n15:    Lonely Boy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Andrew Gold\n14:    Dreams Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fleetwood Mac\n13:    Can't Stop Dancin' Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Captain &amp; Tennille\n12:    Lucille Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kenny Rogers\n11:    Lido Shuffle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Boz Scaggs\n10:    I Wanna Get Next To You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rose Royce\n9:    Got To Give It Up (Part 1) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Marvin Gaye\n8:    IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Your Boogie Man Ã¢â‚¬â€œ K.C. &amp; The Sunshine Band\n7:    So Into You - Atlanta Rhythm Section\n6:    Right Time Of The Night Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jennifer Warnes\n5:    Couldn't Get It Right Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Climax Blues Band\n4:    Southern Nights Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Glen Campbell\n3:    Hotel California Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Eagles\n2:    Sir Duke Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stevie Wonder\n1:    When I Need You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Leo Sayer\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4417ca569a8ca1852b824ba65bdd335b450fdfa","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1977_May_14th_Retorrent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4417ca569a8ca1852b824ba65bdd335b450fdfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,65,124,165,105,168,202,24,82,184,36,186,101,189,211,53,180,80,253,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
