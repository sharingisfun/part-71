We'll then block in colors and textures into the background, middle ground and foreground layers. We'll complete the process of illustration by establishing a focal point and rendering our painting to an appropriate finish.\n\nBy the end of this training you'll understand the importance of staying focused on the procedures and steps used to create a quick and effective environment illustration.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f70ef9bba9d5691b337ca4d33ef64efb9155123d","amp;dn":"Quick+and+Effective+Environment+Illustration+in+Photoshop+-+Digi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f70ef9bba9d5691b337ca4d33ef64efb9155123d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,14,249,187,169,213,105,27,51,124,164,211,62,246,78,251,145,85,18,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
