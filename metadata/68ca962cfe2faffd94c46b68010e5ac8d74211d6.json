The Gilman Paper Company apparently started their collection well before the current photography craze and amassed one of the most outstanding collections that you can imagine. Most of these photos are from the very earliest days of the medium and many are in the sepia tone that I personally love. The quality of reproduction is so good that you can actually frame some of the photos! It's astounding...well worth obtaining for any art book collector.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68ca962cfe2faffd94c46b68010e5ac8d74211d6","amp;dn":"The+Waking+dream+-+Photographys+First+Century+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68ca962cfe2faffd94c46b68010e5ac8d74211d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,202,150,44,254,47,175,253,148,196,107,104,1,14,90,200,215,66,17,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
