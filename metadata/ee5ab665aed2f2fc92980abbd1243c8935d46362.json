Schweber\nPaperback: 432 pages\nPublisher: Harvard University Press (April 29, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 067403452X\nISBN-13: 978-0674034525\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nRelease date: April 29, 2010 | ISBN-10: 067403452X | ISBN-13: 978-0674034525\nAlbert Einstein and J. Robert Oppenheimer, two iconic scientists of the twentieth century, belonged to different generations, with the boundary marked by the advent of quantum mechanics. By exploring how these men differedÃ¢â‚¬â€in their worldview, in their work, and in their dayÃ¢â‚¬â€this book provides powerful insights into the lives of two critical figures and into the scientific culture of their times. In EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and OppenheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s philosophical and ethical positions, their views of nuclear weapons, their ethnic and cultural commitments, their opinions on the unification of physics, even the role of Buddhist detachment in their thinking, the book traces the broader issues that have shaped science and the world.\nEinstein is invariably seen as a lone and singular genius, while Oppenheimer is generally viewed in a particular scientific, political, and historical context. Silvan Schweber considers the circumstances behind this perception, in EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coherent and consistent self-image, and its relation to his singular vision of the world, and in OppenheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contrasting lack of certainty and related non-belief in a unitary, ultimate theory. Of greater importance, perhaps, is the role that timing and chance seem to have played in the two scientistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ contrasting characters and accomplishmentsÃ¢â‚¬â€with EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s having the advantage of maturing at a propitious time for theoretical physics, when the Newtonian framework was showing weaknesses.\nBringing to light little-examined aspects of these lives, Schweber expands our understanding of two great figures of twentieth-century physicsÃ¢â‚¬â€but also our sense of what such greatness means, in personal, scientific, and cultural terms.\n\n===================================================================================\nEditorial Review\nFrom Booklist\n*Starred Review* Typically viewed as solitary geniuses, the two most prominent scientists of twentieth-century AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â€Einstein and OppenheimerÃ¢â‚¬â€here appear in their defining social contexts. Einstein may have achieved remarkable feats in the apparent isolation of a Swiss patent office. Yet Schweber deflates the myth of the iconoclastic loner, detailing the revolutionaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extensive debt to the community of European researchers. SchweberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s insightful narrative indeed reveals how EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subsequent reliance upon his unaided talents left him stranded in sterile theorizing, cut off from the collaboration of younger colleagues exploring quantum mechanics. As one of those colleagues, Oppenheimer captured the limelight as the director of the Manhattan Project, a position awarded him because of the leadership he had already demonstrated in fusing the diverse talents of pioneering scientists at Berkeley. But the publicly triumphant Oppenheimer delved deep in Vedic scripture and American Pragmatism trying to quell self-doubts born of his ambivalent Jewishness and his costly tardiness in reaching the frontiers of physics. Schweber finally confronts readers with ruptures in both menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s public lives, as Einstein breaks with institutions resistant to his personal imperatives and Oppenheimer self-destructs in the glare of a security-clearance hearing. Those interested in the history of culture will learn much from these parallel dramas illuminating the oft-neglected social dynamics of science. --Bryce Christensen --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nWith sensitivity and masterful insight Schweber explores aspects of the lives, thought and personalities of Einstein and OppenheimerÃ¢â‚¬â€their philosophical and ethical positions, and their ethnic and cultural commitmentsÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as their uneasy interaction with each other, their differing views on the unification of physics, and even the role of Buddhist detachment in their thinking. The end result is a book that offers new perspectives on how both scientists responded to the transformations in physics and its relationship with public and political developments brought about by the opening of the atomic age. (David C. Cassidy, author of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the American Century and Einstein and Our World)\n\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking there is little we don't know already about Einstein and Oppenheimer. Yet this book plots the lives of the 20th century's most charismatic physicists to a greater end than biography. Focusing on the cultural milieus in which they thrived, Schweber investigates Einstein and Oppenheimer's very different manifestations of genius--one solitary, one social. Schweber's depth of analysis, particularly in describing both scientists' affinities for Buddhist thought, insists that there is much more to learn about each. (Seed 2008-03-01)\n\nThe real interest of Mr. Schweber's account--and what makes his dual biography unusual--is the emphasis he places not on Einstein's or Oppenheimer's scientific achievements, which have been often enough described, but on their later careers, when both found themselves, for different reasons, strangely sidelined. (Eric Ormsby New York Sun 2008-05-21)\n\nSchweber has set himself quite a task in seeking to add to our understanding [of Einstein and Oppenheimer]. By my reckoning he has succeeded, not so much by uncovering significant new material as by reflecting wisely and eloquently on Einstein's and Oppenheimer's politics, their relationships with their colleagues, and their contributions to science. (Lawrence Black Times Higher Education Supplement 2008-05-22)\n\nHave we not heard enough of these two men? Yet Silvan S. Schweber shows us in his new book, Einstein and Oppenheimer, that there is still more to say. What we know about these two giants of physics largely concerns their genius--their formidable mental powers--but this focus tends to foreground the individual at the expense of intellectual and scientific context. Schweber's aim is ambitious: to capture another quality that he calls the greatness of Einstein and Oppenheimer--to show how their actions altered humanity's &quot;ideas concerning what human beings can be or do.&quot; We know much about the genius of these two men, Schweber implies, but little of their greatness. (Robert P. Crease American Scientist 2008-09-01)\n\nIn a brief review, it is not possible to do full justice to Schweber's probing book, which merits careful reading. (Michael W. Friedlander Physics World 2009-02-01)\n\nIn six illuminating essays focusing on the later years of these fascinating figures, Schweber shows that no scientist--however great--is an island. (P.D. Smith The Guardian 2010-01-16)\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nSilvan S.
