Developers can grab Build 13C39 from the Mac Dev Center, or by running a software update if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re already running the first beta.\n\n\nThe seed notes donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t list any new features, but ask devs to focus on Mail, Messages, graphics drives, VoiceOver, VPN and SMB2. The last beta added FaceTime over audio to the Messages and FaceTime apps.  Apple also seeded the first beta of Safari 6.1.2 to developers that looks like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mostly filled with bug fixes.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67af5756196b7c828823cde833318d0d292b5dc9","amp;dn":"OS+X+Mavericks+10.9.2+Build+13C39","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67af5756196b7c828823cde833318d0d292b5dc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,175,87,86,25,107,124,130,136,35,205,232,51,49,141,13,41,43,93,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
