The Property Brothers come to the rescue and help the couple find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time. With a budget that doesn't match the couple's expectations, Drew and Jonathan struggle to sell the potential of a fixer-upper. The couple decides between two major renovation projects, and the brothers have six weeks to do a complete gut job. But everything comes to a roaring halt when they discover asbestos in the walls. Then, Jonathan exposes scary structural problems that must be fixed. Time is running out and the unexpected costs pile up causing major stress for Delecia. Dwayne, on the other hand, has no regard for the budget and can't stop making design upgrades. While the couple squabbles, Jonathan races to finish the job.\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e251f61b00abd8d0db13b378db9a86b8c8a51066","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s02e13.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e251f61b00abd8d0db13b378db9a86b8c8a51066","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,81,246,27,0,171,216,208,219,19,179,120,219,154,134,184,200,165,16,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
