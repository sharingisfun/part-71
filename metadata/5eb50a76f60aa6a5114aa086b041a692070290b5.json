Rumi (Rituparna Sengupta) is a sensitive woman and an artist who is expecting their second child. They \n\nlive with their son and Kingshuk's parents. On his marriage anniversary Kingshuk goes to buy a new flat for his wife. As he \n\nis negotiating the deal, he learns that one of his patients, Kabita Mandal (Sohini Sengupta) is critically ill.He completes his \n\ndeal and tries to hurry back but it is too late. Kabita dies of post operative complications. Her irate husband and family go on \n\nthe rampage, smashing up the nursing home. Rumi rushes to be at the side of her husband and is confronted by the dead \n\nbody of Kabita..\n\nAs she learns that her husband is at least partly responsible, Rumi starts to hallucinate. She imagines that Kabita has come \n\nto haunt her. Kabita is Rumi's conscience, urging her to convince her husband to atone for his faults. In the meantime, \n\nKabita's husband files a complaint against Kingshuk who faces compensation claims and an investigation by a medical \n\nboard. Rumi's idealism comes into conflict with the practical cynical world of Kingshuk and their differences mount.\n\nKingshuk buys off his detractors and is set to resume his old lifestyle, when Rumi, driven by her hallucinations, meets with \n\nan accident and has a miscarriage. As she lies in need of an immediate operation, Kingshuk rushes to her side only to learn \n\nthat the operation hasn't taken place because the anaesthetist is late. Like Kabita's husband, he loses his cool and roughs up \n\nthe attending doctor.\n\nAs Kingshuk realises his mistake and realises how he has treated his patients, his penitence at last drives the ghost of \n\nKabita is laid to rest and the couple unites again for a moment of fleeting happiness.\n\n\nComments:\n---------\nAfter Shiboprosad Mukherjee's disastrous film &quot;Hello Memsahib&quot; the Nandita Shiboprosad duo brings us a film that is \n\nreminiscent of their great success &quot;Icche&quot;. Make no mistake, based on a novel by Suchitra Bhattacharya, this is a serious \n\nfilm that explores the conflict in Rumi's mind on one hand and on the other, is a scathing commentary on the way the \n\nmedical profession operates - throwing ethics and even the hippocratic oath to the winds. You begin to understand the sense \n\nof angst that permeates the film, when you learn that Shiboprasad the director, had lost his father in similar circumstances, \n\nwhen no doctor was available on a holiday.\n\nIf Kingshuk is a loving husband and a good doctor, he also ruthlessly pursues wealth, often at the cost of the care that he \n\nshould have bestowed on his patients. His colleagues cynically advise him to buy off his detractors and he tells his old \n\nmentor that he can never follow the level of ethics demanded by his profession. It is only when he is faced with the same \n\nsituation as Kabita Mandal's husband did, that he realises the folly of his ways. Yet the film does not tell us that he will mend \n\nhis ways. We only learn that his penitence gets him a fleeting momentof happiness.\n\nRituparna won the best actress award for her role in this film. She is very good with her nuanced acting and portrayal of self \n\ndoubt. She is supported by some great acting by Sohini Sengupta, although I have to admit that both ladies had relatively \n\neasy roles because they were so well defined. Moreover, this is really a film from a woman's perspective. It is Debshankar \n\nHaldar as Dr. Kingshuk Ghosh who steals the show. His Dr. Kingshuk is portrayed immaculately as he goes through a \n\nrange of emotions - anger, despair, elation, greed, bewilderment, over-confidence and so on. His portrayal of Kingshuk's \n\nconflicts with his wife's emotional approach is a pleasure to watch. \n\nThe film is not without its flaws. The renewed love life of Biswajit Mandal is completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the \n\nstory. Soumitra as the aged doctor urging Kingshuk to mend his ways, is unconvincing in his pontification and oratory. \n\nRumi's hallucination that leads her to dangerous places like the pond steps is not treated by a psychiatrist even though her \n\nhusband, a doctor knows that she is hallucinating and is pregnant. The accent of Debshankar Haldar as well as his swearing \n\nis jarring. A high society doctor has to use a more refined language. It is also at a variance with the language used by his \n\nparents and his wife. \n\nTechnically, I wan't too impressed by the musical score of Joy Sarkar. In particular, I thought the music when Sohini \n\nSengupta appears was too loud and needlessly dark. Shirsha Ray's cinematography is brilliant. His unusual camera angles \n\nactually add meaning to the scenes. Editing by Malay Laha is pedestrian.\n\nBut despite its flaws, this is a good film. If you liked &quot;Icche&quot;, you will find that this film too will strike a chord. Not the least \n\nbecause the Directors extract superb performances from the key actors.\n\n\nUploader's Notes:\n------------------------\n\nDTH rips of this movie have been uploaded before. I think this is the first DVD rip. If you are wondering why I chose to do an \n\nupscale, take a look at the screenshots and the screenshots. Even in the upscale there is a wealth of detail. In fact, the \n\ndetails are less obvious in the normal DVD. This is a rare case where the upscale is actually better than the original.\n\nIMDB Link:\n--------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3584732/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3584732/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSample:\n-----------\n\nRipper:\n-------\ndebpk77","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eb50a76f60aa6a5114aa086b041a692070290b5","amp;dn":"+ALEEK.SUKH-DVD.Upscale-720p-x264.AC3-Esubs-1.53GB-%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eb50a76f60aa6a5114aa086b041a692070290b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,181,10,118,246,10,166,165,17,74,160,134,176,65,166,146,7,2,144,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
