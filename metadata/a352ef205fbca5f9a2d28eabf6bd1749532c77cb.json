You Are Here examines the rise of our technologically aided era of navigational omniscienceÃ¢â‚¬â€or how we came to know exactly where we are at all times. In a sweeping history of the development of location technology in the past century, Bray shows how radio signals created to carry telegraph messages were transformed into invisible beacons to guide ships and how a set of rapidly-spinning wheels steered submarines beneath the polar ice cap. But while most of these technologies were developed for and by the military, they are now ubiquitous in our everyday lives. Our phones are now smart enough to pinpoint our presence to within a few feetÃ¢â‚¬â€and nosy enough to share that information with governments and corporations. Filled with tales of scientists and astronauts, inventors and entrepreneurs, You Are Here tells the story of how humankind ingeniously solved one of its oldest and toughest problemsÃ¢â‚¬â€only to herald a new era in which itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impossible to hide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a352ef205fbca5f9a2d28eabf6bd1749532c77cb","amp;dn":"You+Are+Here%3A+From+the+Compass+to+GPS+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a352ef205fbca5f9a2d28eabf6bd1749532c77cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,82,239,32,95,188,165,249,162,210,142,171,246,189,23,73,83,44,119,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
