O'Brien plays a sheriff who takes full credit for the arrest of dangerous outlaw Raymond Burr. \n[img]http://www.freeimage.us/image-AAFF_539E5686.jpg[/img]\nIn fact, young Donald McDonald, the brother of O'Brien's fiancee Nancy Gates, was largely responsible for Burr's capture, but the sheriff refuses to reveal McDonald's part in the arrest for fear that the boy will be killed by Burr's cohorts. Unfortunately, the local newspaper editor believes that O'Brien simply wants to cheat the boy out of his share of the reward money. The editor blithely prints up the full story in his paper, leading to a near-disastrous denoument.\n[img]http://www.freeimage.us/image-29F5_539E5686.jpg[/img]\nDistinguishing himself is Raymond Burr, with yet another individualized bad guy performance.Tris Hatten is a rotten thief and murderer and knows it, but he's earned the love of his main squeeze girlfriend and is popular among the gunslinger demographic (this territory seems overrun with unemployed gunslingers). \n[img]http://www.freeimage.us/image-2C91_539E5686.jpg[/img]\nSmart enough to know when to stop bullying people and grateful for the help he receives from another crook, cool customer Tris just wants to escape to Mexico , after leaving the Sheriff behind in a pool of blood, of course. What's so unreasonable about that?\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 932mb\nDuration.... 01:19:46\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 640\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate....1495kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 133kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac677dd03ee3023055c8dd274c5e8800dedc0380","amp;dn":"The+Brass+Legend+1957+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac677dd03ee3023055c8dd274c5e8800dedc0380","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,103,125,208,62,227,2,48,85,200,221,39,76,94,136,0,222,220,3,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
