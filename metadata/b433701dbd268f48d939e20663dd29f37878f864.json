When dissecting each individual issue, Bergland does well at explaining the folly of government intervention, the unintended consequences thereof, and how individual liberty would make the situation better. He is the first to say that Utopia is not an option, so his argument is that the better way is the libertarian way. This book is geared to the layperson and presents an alternative way to look at government in a moral and practical sense.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b433701dbd268f48d939e20663dd29f37878f864","amp;dn":"%5B1990%5D+Libertarianism+in+One+Lessson.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b433701dbd268f48d939e20663dd29f37878f864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,51,112,29,189,38,143,72,217,57,226,6,99,221,41,243,120,120,248,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
