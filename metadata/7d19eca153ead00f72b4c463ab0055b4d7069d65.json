His knowledge of Jewish Feasts often goes overlooked by other church demoninations, so the flock is left in unawares.  Great insight is given to help educate the flock in his teachings.\n\nMark Biltz, founder of El Shaddai Ministries in Washington State is a well-known\nand popular commentator on the Feasts of the Lord and has produced a series of\nDvd's on the Feasts that have gone around the world. His research and theories\nhave earned him guest appearances on both radio and television as well the cover of\nmagazines. He teaches how the Messianic prophecies that Jesus fulfilled 2,000\nyears ago when He came the first time happened to the very day. He then explains\nhow the second coming events will also happen to the very day of the Fall Feasts.\nYeshua died for our sins on Passover, was buried on the Feast of Unleavened Bread,\nresurrected from death on First Fruits, and then sent the Holy Spirit to indwell\nbelievers on the Jewish Feast of Pentecost (Shavuot). If He fulfilled the spring\nFeasts to the day of His first coming He will fulfill the Fall Feasts to the day of\nHis second coming.\n\nHe has also revealed a link between charts of solar and lunar eclipses from NASA's\nwebsite with Israel's history, the Biblical feast days, and signs in the heavens\ndrawing clear similarities between them, lining up through history. He's spoken at\ncongregations &amp; conferences in Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, and Canada as well\nin the U.S. in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, New Mexico,\nMinnesota, Pennsylvania, and Florida. He has been interviewed by FOX television,\nappeared on the Sid Roth television broadcast as well as on Prophecy in the News.\nHe's been interviewed by many radio stations across the United States and Canada.\n\nEl Shaddai Ministries P.O.

We strongly believe that these animal deaths are fulfilling bible scripture. Revelation chapter 8 verses 8, part of 9 says;\n\n8 The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood, 9 a third of the living creatures in the sea died...  \n\n(Personally, I don't think these events are part of that actual Revelation, rather it's precursor or the worldwide &quot;birthpains&quot; leading us into the End-Times events.)\n\nTime stamps:\n2008 videos - 1:19\n2009 videos - 5:02\n2010 videos - 8:35\n2011 videos - 16:40\n2012 videos - 25:07\n2013 videos - 40:15\n2013 headline compilation - 58:46\n2014 videos - 1:44:30\n2014 headline compilation - 2:01:08\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIsralestine - Blueprint to coming Middle East Wars between Israel and its Neighbors:\nMay 15, 2014; Bill Salus on the Hangman Report discusses our current events that plays into bible prophecy.  Using videos and slide shows to illustrate these events, they showcase these prophectic signs (including the Blood Moon Tetrads) that are leading us into the upcoming Middle East Wars, that will ultimately help shape the One World Order of the End TImes.  \n\nOne prophetic event not mentioned in this discussion id that dealing with Egypt's 40 Years of Desolation which will more likely occur as a result of the Psalms 83 War.  In Ezekiel 29:12-14, God says Ã¢â‚¬Å“And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. (13)  Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered: (14)  And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  This prophecy has yet to be fulfilled and seems a likely candidate for Psalms 83 when Israel's neighboring Muslim enemies attack her and God intervenes, resulting in the first time ever when Israel actually captures all her God given lands (expanding her boarders).\n\nOther notables in this video include...\nWorld War 3 : The Russian Bear of Gog Magog and Ezekiel Hook of Natural Gas in Israel (Mar 27, 2014)\n\nThe Hagmann and Hagmann Report: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.homelandsecurityus.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.homelandsecurityus.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBill Salus: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.prophecydepotministries.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.prophecydepotministries.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNews Articles:\nReport: Vatican Will Gain More Control Over King David's Tomb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/180625#.U3Tub1fW6XV&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/180625#.U3Tub1fW6XV&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNetanyahu orders IDF to prepare for possible strike on Iran during 2014 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.580701&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.580701&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDozens feared injured as massive fire sweeps through N.

Please sit tight and watch Pastor Blitz present fabulous biblical interpretations hidden within scriptures for the first time.  The flock should to hear this.\n\nFrom Pastor Mark Biltz... We find an incredible amount of duplication: 2 lists of the kings servants: Esther 1:10 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, Esther 1:14 And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;) 2 reports of Esther's hidden identity: Esther 2:10 Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it. Esther 2:20 Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him. 2 houses for the women: Esther 2:14 In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, 2 gatherings of the women: Esther 2:19 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate. 2 unscheduled appearances before the king: Esther 5:2 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre. Esther 8:3,4 And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king, Twice Haman's head covered: Esther 6:12,13 And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. Two references to the death of Haman's sons: Esther 9:10 The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand...
