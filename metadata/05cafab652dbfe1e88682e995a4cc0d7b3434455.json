Produced by John Houseman, it was a sponsored continuation of The Mercury Theatre on the Air. The series offered 60-minute adaptations of classic plays and novels, plus some adaptations of popular motion pictures.\n\nAfter the departure of Welles at the end of the second season, The Campbell Playhouse changed format as a 30-minute weekly series that ran for one season (1940Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1941).\n\nAs a direct result of the front-page headlines Orson Welles generated with his 1938 Halloween production The War of the Worlds, Campbell's Soup signed on as sponsor. The Mercury Theatre on the Air made its last broadcast December 4, 1938, and The Campbell Playhouse began December 9, 1938.\n\nThe same creative staff stayed on, but the show had a different flavor under sponsorship. This was partially due to a guest star policy which relegated the Mercury Players to supporting roles. There was a growing schism between Welles, still reaping the rewards of his Halloween night notoriety, and Houseman, who became more like an employee than a partner. The primary writer, as during the end of the unsponsored run, was Howard Koch.\n\nAfter 20 shows, Campbell began to exercise more creative control over The Campbell Playhouse, and had complete control over story selection. Diana Bourbon, an account executive from the Ward Wheelock agency, was appointed as liaison between Welles and Campbell. Bourbon acted as de-facto producer, and she and Welles frequently clashed over story and casting. Amiable classics were chosen over many of Welles's story suggestions, including Of Human Hearts; the rights to many works, including Rogue Male, Wuthering Heights and The Little Foxes, could not be obtained. As his contract with Campbell came to an end, Welles determined not to sign on for another season. &quot;I'm sick of having the heart torn out of a script by radio censorship,&quot; he said. After the broadcast of March 31, 1940 Ã¢â‚¬â€ a reprise of Jane Eyre, after Welles's suggestion of Alice Adams was not accepted Ã¢â‚¬â€ Welles and Campbell parted amicably.&quot;  -- from Wikipedia\n\nThis torrent includes 51 episodes and a 39 minute Orson Welles documentary by Leonard Maltin, all in mp3 format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05cafab652dbfe1e88682e995a4cc0d7b3434455","amp;dn":"The+Campbell+Playhouse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05cafab652dbfe1e88682e995a4cc0d7b3434455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,202,250,182,82,219,254,30,136,104,46,153,90,76,192,215,179,67,68,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
