When she finds out that she is to attend a private academy for magical children, Gertie hopes to find her witchy way in the world. \n\nWith a moat monster suffering from stomach ache, a short-sighted owl familiar and mishaps galore, GertieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adventures are hilarious and heartwarming. Join Gertie as she struggles with growing up (and longing to grow her first wart), learning magic and working out how to deal with a grumpy enchanted umbrella, named Bat.\n\nGenre: Young Adult / Juvenile Fiction / Humor\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd348577c97c0d16b766eda8385adadd0072d7be","amp;dn":"Caution%3A+Witch+In+Progress+by+Lynne+North","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd348577c97c0d16b766eda8385adadd0072d7be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,52,133,119,201,124,13,22,183,102,237,168,56,90,218,221,0,114,215,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
