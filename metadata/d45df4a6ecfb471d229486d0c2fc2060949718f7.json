It's a website, as of 1/20/2014.\n\nThe reason for this is freedom of speech.  My hosting gets sabotaged,\nposts deleted, and emails disappear.  If somebody doesn't like this\nwebsite that much then I feel desperate to share it.  I'm paranoid,\nbut 5 or so years of being gang-stalked will do that to you.\n\nThe pages here contain ideas that are based on pudding, because the\nproof is in the pudding.  I hope it can spark conversation, the ideas\nof your own, and hone our understanding of truth.  Please seed it,\nshare it, even host it.  Anything to combat those people who try to\nprevent us from finding any actual solutions.\n\nGood luck, that we prevail in the challenge of existence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d45df4a6ecfb471d229486d0c2fc2060949718f7","amp;dn":"Eternal+City+Xoap+Backup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d45df4a6ecfb471d229486d0c2fc2060949718f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,93,244,166,236,251,71,29,34,148,134,208,194,252,32,96,148,151,24,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
