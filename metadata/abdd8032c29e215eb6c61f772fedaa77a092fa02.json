She wants to be left in peace to run her dive resort on Seafire Isle.\n\nBut unexplained events continue to happen. Adam O'Connor--Samantha's ex-lover--arrives unannounced on the tiny island. Samantha becomes the target of an attempted kidnapping. And she's beginning to realize that none of the resort's guests are who they claim to be.\n\nCaught in an undertow of lies and murder, Samantha confronts the secrets that have, for centuries, been drawing men to their watery graves. And she realizes that the little she knows about the lost treasure is more than enough to get her killed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abdd8032c29e215eb6c61f772fedaa77a092fa02","amp;dn":"Heather+Graham+-+Eyes+of+Fire+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abdd8032c29e215eb6c61f772fedaa77a092fa02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,221,128,50,194,158,33,94,182,198,31,119,47,237,170,119,160,146,250,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
