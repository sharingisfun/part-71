Montgomery's bop period ended much too soon, but thankfully, he recorded his share of rewarding bop albums when he was still bop-oriented -- and one of them is Boss Guitar, which Orrin Keepnews produced in 1963. It's a trio recording, employing Mel Rhyne on organ and Jimmy Cobb on performances that have held up well over time; Montgomery shows how expressive a ballad player he could be on the standards &quot;For Heaven's Sake&quot; and &quot;Days of Wine and Roses,&quot; but the fast tempo exuberance of &quot;The Trick Bag&quot; (a Montgomery original) serves him equally well. Montgomery swings the blues with pleasing results on &quot;Fried Pies&quot; (another Montgomery original), while Consuelo VelÃƒÂ¡zquez's &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; (which is usually played at a slow ballad tempo) is successfully transformed into medium-tempo Latin jazz. Boss Guitar is among the bop-oriented Montgomery albums that should continue to be savored after all these years.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Besame Mucho 6:28\n2 Dearly Beloved      4:49\n3 Days Of Wine And Roses 3:44\n4 The Trick Bag 4:25\n5 Canadian Sunset 5:04\n6 Fried Pies 6:42\n7 The Breeze And I 4:08\n10 For Heaven's Sake 4:39\n\nCredits\n\n   Drums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jimmy Cobb\n   Engineer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ray Fowler\n   Guitar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wes Montgomery\n   Organ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mel Rhyne\n   Producer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Orrin Keepnews ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffe4d26d5b4d8f8ff5e1f69fa5788b73aa14cb35","amp;dn":"%7B24+96%7D+Wes+Montgomery+-+Boss+Guitar+1963+%7Bvinyl%7D+FLAC++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffe4d26d5b4d8f8ff5e1f69fa5788b73aa14cb35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,228,210,109,91,77,143,143,245,225,246,159,165,120,139,115,170,20,203,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
