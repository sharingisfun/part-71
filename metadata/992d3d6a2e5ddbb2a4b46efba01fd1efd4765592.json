In this phase of production, we'll discuss the importance of the creative team's input and collaboration to create fun and appealing game assets that all fit together in the same world. Along the way we'll be sharing with you the feedback on these concepts, in addition to how the 2D environment can be realized and managed across layers in Photoshop.\n\nFollowing this training, you'll continue on through the production pipeline with a series of courses involving the development of our game.\n\nYou'll learn everything from prototyping the character's movement, interaction, and functionality in Unity, along with how our final concepts of the hero and boss can be modeled, sculpted and textured using Maya LT and Z-Brush. In addition, we'll see them spring to life as we learn how to rig and create stunning animations in Maya LT that will be incorporated into the final game. Finally, you'll learn how to use Unity to assemble our game's 2D and 3D assets for a fun and magical gaming experience.\n\nAfter watching this entire pipeline process, you'll have the knowledge needed to take your own indie game to the next level! \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.digitaltutors.com/tutorial/1531-Indie-Game-Development-Pipeline-Volume-1-Visual-Development&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.digitaltutors.com/tutorial/1531-Indie-Game-Development-Pipeline-Volume-1-Visual-Development&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:992d3d6a2e5ddbb2a4b46efba01fd1efd4765592","amp;dn":"Indie+Game+Development+Pipeline+Vol+1%3A+Visual+Development+Digita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"992d3d6a2e5ddbb2a4b46efba01fd1efd4765592","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,45,61,106,46,93,219,178,164,180,110,251,160,31,209,239,212,118,85,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
