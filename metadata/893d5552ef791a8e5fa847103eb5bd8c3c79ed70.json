Sure, you can use something like MAMP, but, very quickly, this breaks down. What happens when you want to install Beanstalk? What if you need a special extension? Because &quot;all-in-one&quot; utilities tuck away much of the complexity, these sorts of installations can be difficult to perform.\n\nHere at Laracasts, we're big fans of virtual machines - specifically, with Vagrant. As part of Laravel's mission to assist you from development to deployment, Homestead (a custom Vagrant box) is &quot;Taylor-made&quot; for your Laravel workflow.
