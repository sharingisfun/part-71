You can find examples of caricatures in all forms of media such as editorial cartoons, entertainment magazines, and animated shows.\n\nIn this course we'll focus on how we can visually portray someone as a caricature in more than just one way by sketching two contrasting caricatures of each actor. For each actor that we reference we'll discuss and observe certain facial features that stand out to us and how we can emphasize them by a means of exaggeration, simplification, spatial relationships, and visual contrast.\n\nAfter watching this training, you'll have the inspiration to create your own caricatures!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deb1af33f1e249050637e3ed0d169bcbe158057a","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Capturing+the+Essence+of+Caricatures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deb1af33f1e249050637e3ed0d169bcbe158057a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,177,175,51,241,226,73,5,6,55,227,237,13,22,155,203,225,88,5,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
