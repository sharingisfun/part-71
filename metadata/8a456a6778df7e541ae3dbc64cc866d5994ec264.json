Having achieved modest fame for co-directing the mocumentary Forgotten Silver together with Peter Jackson, he now spends his time attacking what little fans he has through a blog (www.costabotes.com) where he publishes personal attacks at administrators of filesharing sites. He has also gone on TV and radio whining about how pirates are the blame of all his troubles, and calls the director of TPB:AFK a Ã¢â‚¬Å“shitty little lying sack of shitÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. To spice it up he also makes several personal attacks on Kim Dotcom, and argues that the bitcoin currency should be disbanded because he thinks that would stop TPB. He also hates remixers of all kinds, together with youtube, spotify, netflix, and pretty much all technology newer than the steam engine. By his logic, no one should sees his films, if he doesn't make any money of it.\n\nThis package contains most of the films he doesn't want anyone to see, including:\n\nThe Last Dogs of Winter (2011)\nCandyman - The David Klein Story (2010)\nBehind the Scenes documentaries of The Lord of the Rings (2002)\n\tFellowship of the Ring\n\tThe Two Towers\n\tReturn of the King\nForgotten Silver (1995)\n\nThe reason this collection is currently v.1, is because there are three films missing. If anyone has any of the following films, please share them on TPB, so that the collection can be updated:\nDaytime Tiger (2011)\nSaving Grace (1998)\nOriginal Skin (1996)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a456a6778df7e541ae3dbc64cc866d5994ec264","amp;dn":"Costa+Botes+v.1+-+The+movies+of+the+world%27s+loudest+anti-pirate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a456a6778df7e541ae3dbc64cc866d5994ec264","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,69,106,103,120,223,126,84,26,227,219,198,76,200,102,213,153,78,194,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
