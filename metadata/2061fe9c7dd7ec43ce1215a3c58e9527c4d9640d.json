To answer that question, the companion book to the critically acclaimed documentary I.O.U.S.A. talks with some of the most revered voices in the nation, including Warren Buffett; former Treasury Secretaries Paul OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Neill and Robert Rubin; Pete Peterson, CEO of The Blackstone Group; Congressman Ron Paul (R-Texas); and bestselling Empire of Debt author Bill Bonner. \nArmed with these interviews, historical references, and damning statistics, the book takes a lively and entertaining romp through the four deficits the nation faces: the budget deficit, the personal savings deficit, the trade deficitÃ¢â‚¬â€and what former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker, who resigned abruptly in 2008 over CongressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lack of action, calls the Ã¢â‚¬Å“leadership deficitÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Washington. \nDefiantly non-partisan, the empowering solutions outlined in these pages are a must-read for any American who wants to help change Ã¢â‚¬Å“business-as-usualÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Washington as a new administration heads towards the Oval Office. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We the PeopleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ can get our politicians to stop spending, promote responsible economic programs, and hand our children and grandchildren the secure future they deserve.
