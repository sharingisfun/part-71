It's no surprise that a number of ROMs already on this list are at least partially based on AOKP.\n\nThere's currently support for Nexus devices, including the Galaxy S3 and S4, HTC One, and several Sony Xperia models.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fe3e1635355a7e3e0069a159a120052e205e775","amp;dn":"Android+Open+Kang+Project_derived+from+Android+4.4+KitKat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fe3e1635355a7e3e0069a159a120052e205e775","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,227,225,99,83,85,167,227,224,6,154,21,154,18,0,82,226,5,231,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
