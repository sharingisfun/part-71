Born in 1979, the grandmaster from Uzbekistan has for many years been known as a very strong and imaginative player. However in 2004 Rustam Kasimdzhanov (pronounced Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kah-zeem-jha-novÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) shocked the chess world by winning the FIDE world chess championship title, beating a string of world-class players like Ivanchuk, Grischuk, Topalov and Adams in the process. Kasimdzhanov is a very deep player, who is able to explain chess ideas in an eloquent, lucid style, with a fine touch of humour. His lessons are both entertaining and instructive Ã¢â‚¬â€œ perfect for students who seek to avoid Ã¢â‚¬Å“dryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ theory.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shop.chessbase.com/en/products/attacking_the_king-for_experts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shop.chessbase.com/en/products/attacking_the_king-for_experts&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c869a086c85353c9baf8ce79fb9e372eea053160","amp;dn":"Attacking+the+king+for+experts+by+Rustam+Kasimdzhanov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c869a086c85353c9baf8ce79fb9e372eea053160","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,105,160,134,200,83,83,201,186,248,206,121,251,158,55,46,234,5,49,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
