What Would You Do\n\nJudging from the sound of the four songs already released from this album, it almost seems as though Tigers Jaw never quite changed their style after Two Worlds. The vocals are clearer and the sound smoother, but without the band's backbone sound in Tigers Jaw's self-titled full length, the band seems to have shifted slightly to a softer, and more matured level of rock with each release. Although the bland, and somewhat uncreative lyrical track &quot;Cool&quot; sounds as though it may be filler for the unreleased tracks, Tigers Jaw's style still runs thin, with a cutting edge that may no longer be at it's peak, but a refined stature somewhere below.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8f2d93b6dba436fb40522318161fd8d527f716f","amp;dn":"Tigers+Jaw+-+Charmer+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8f2d93b6dba436fb40522318161fd8d527f716f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,242,217,59,109,186,67,111,180,5,34,49,129,97,253,141,82,127,113,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
