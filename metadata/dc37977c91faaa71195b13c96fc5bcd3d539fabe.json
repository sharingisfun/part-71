While some rare records go for hundreds of dollars, an \noriginal copy of The Churchills is likely to fetch thousands. Why? Because not only \nis it next to impossible to find, but The Churchills is one of those rarer-than-rare\nrecords that actually lives up to its reputation. From the opening bars of the first\n song on Side One, &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; - an explosion of ecstatic screams and fuzz, \n&quot;faces, lips and teeth and eyes; diamond rings and pretty things, and arms and legs \nand thighs&quot; - you know this is going to be one amazing trip. \n Track after track the album continues to astonish, delivering everything from \nelectrifying psychedelic rock to evocative pop ballads with equal degrees of skill \nand originality. Soulfully delivered vocals, searing fuzz guitars, spacey sound \neffects, exotic Eastern flourishes - the Churchills use a dazzling palate of tones \nand colours, stretching the primitive Tel Aviv studio technology of the day to its \nlimits to create one of the most brilliant psychedelic albums from anywhere in the \nworld, let alone Israel. Although there's elements of the Yardbirds, Cream, Hendrix \nthe Doors, and the Jefferson Airplane (especially the studio trickery of After \nBathing At Baxter's), the sound of the Churchills is very much their own personal \nvision - a distinct blend of East and West that is unmistakably from their own \ncorner of the world.\n\nHope I won't be sued by one of the copyright owners as my country of residence is (yeah that's right)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc37977c91faaa71195b13c96fc5bcd3d539fabe","amp;dn":"Churchill%27s-Churchill%27s%281968%29-180g+UK+LP%2FFLAC+24bit%2F96kHz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc37977c91faaa71195b13c96fc5bcd3d539fabe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,55,151,124,145,250,170,113,25,91,19,201,111,197,188,211,213,57,250,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
