I love Lio, and I don't believe in guilty pleasures, so I love Lio openly and honestly. Lio makes me laugh. As you may have guessed from my uploads, my sense of humor is a bit thin, or at the very least, dark. And still, Lio makes me laugh. And Lio makes me smile. It makes me laugh and smile in the the same way that The Far Side or Calvin and Hobbes made me laugh and smile, only its darker and more twisted than either of those examples. For me, there can never be too many Lio books, so I'm quite happy to have a few more to upload...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSilent But Deadly: A Lio Collection\n\nMark Tatulli\n\nAndrews McMeel Publishing, 2008, 128 pages\n\nWith a feature film in the works from producer David Kirschner (Child's Play, An American Tail), LIO deftly melds the macabre with its brand of dark humor.\n\nHaving been distinguished by Variety as &quot;a fast riser,&quot; Mark Tatulli's morbidly mirthful pantomime comic strip, LIO, is humorously astute and just slightly askew in its perception of the world.\n\nCentered around an odd, ghostly-pale child named LIO, and his creepy coterie of friends, including a giant squid named Ishmael and a scythe-carrying grim reaper, LIO; is influenced by cartooning greats Gahan Wilson, Charles Addams, and 19th-century satirist A. J. Volck.
