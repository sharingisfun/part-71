For Love Spit Love's second album, Trysome Eatone, Butler decided to rely on the darkly seductive blend of arty post-punk and glam-rock that was the Furs' trademark. It's partially nostalgia, but he was able to update the Furs sound with a sharp, clever production and the occasional electronic or alternative flourish. It evokes the '80s without slavishly recreating the sound, but Trysome Eatone manages to be more than a guilty pleasure for longtime Furs fans because of Butler's solid craftmanship. Many of the album's songs are well-written and memorable, resulting in a record that represents a return to form for one of the early '80s' most distinctive artists.
