The traditional business model dictates that marketers own the message while sellers own the relationships. But now, Jantsch flips the usual sales approach on its head.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no longer enough to view a salespersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s job as closing. TodayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s superstars must attract, teach, convert, serve, and measure while developing a personal brand that stands for trust and expertise.\n\nIn Duct Tape Selling, Jantsch shows how to tackle a changing sales environment, whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re an individual or charged with leading a sales team. You will learn to think like a marketer as you:\n\nCreate an expert platform\n\nBecome an authority in your field\n\nMine networks to create critical relationships within your company and among your clients\n\nBuild and utilize your Sales Hourglass\n\nFinish the sale and stay connected\n\nMake referrals an automatic part of your process\n\nAs Jantsch writes: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Most people already know that the days of knocking on doors and hard-selling are over. But as I travel around the world speaking to groups of business owners, marketers, and sales professionals, the number one question IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m asked is, Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhat do we do now?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve written this book specifically to answer that question. At the heart of it, marketing and sales have become activities that no longer simply support each other so much as feed off of each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s activity. Sales professionals must think and act like marketers in order to completely reframe their role in the mind of the customer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nReview\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Duct Tape Selling explores several counterintuitive routes to sales success, but it starts with the most important skill of all: listening. If we want to move othersÃ¢â‚¬â€with our ideas, our products, our services, or even ourselvesÃ¢â‚¬â€we have to slow down and understand what our counterparts are saying. And if you listen to John Jantsch, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn the attitudes and abilities required to master the new world of sales.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Daniel H. Pink, author, To Sell Is Human and Drive\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Duct Tape Selling totally reframes the sales process, showing sellers how to leverage marketing strategies to connect, build value, and win more business.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Jill Konrath, author, Agile Selling and SNAP Selling\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In an ever more connected society, consultative selling is (fortunately) the new driver of growth. Once again, John Jantsch turns our expectations upside down and shines a light on a better way to get things done.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Seth Godin, author, The Icarus Deception\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Jantsch brings the concept of inbound selling to life with practical, actionable advice that can help turn any sales rep into a sales superstar. From effective storytelling to optimizing your social profile for success, JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advice will give aspiring and existing salespeople alike the tools, context, and information they need to meet the needs of twenty-first-century buyers.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Brian Halligan, HubSpot CEO and co-author, Inbound Marketing\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Duct Tape Selling holds answers for how real-world salespeople can connect and stick with real-world customers. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re tired of seeing your sales fall apart, John Jantsch has the real-world answers.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Jeffrey Gitomer, author, Little Red Book of Selling and 21.5 Unbreakable Laws of Selling\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Duct Tape Selling does a fantastic job defining why the world of sales has changed, what the new world of sales looks like, and how you can become a modern sales professional.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Jill Rowley, social selling evangelist, Oracle\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJOHN JANTSCH is a marketing consultant, speaker, and the acclaimed author of Duct Tape Marketing, The Commitment Engine and The Referral Engine.
