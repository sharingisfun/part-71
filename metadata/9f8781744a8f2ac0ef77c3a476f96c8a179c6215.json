Amit feels an infatuation for Bhasha when she comes for an audition to him. Sunaina does not feel comfortable with Tapash anymore. Bhasha doubts Tapash and says that she wants a divorce. They get divorced. Everybody tries to understand their own actual feelings. They try to get perfect partners for themselves. Sunaina breaks up with Tapash and proposes to Raj. Shreya decides to go for an arranged marriage. Bhasha and Amit get close. Everybody finds the right partner.
